AB Application of computing and communications intelligence effectively improves the quality of monitoring and control of smart grids. However, the dependence on information technology also increases vulnerability to malicious attacks. False data injection (FDI), that attack on the integrity of data, is emerging as a severe threat to the supervisory control and data acquisition system. In this paper, we exploit deep learning techniques to recognize the behavior features of FDI attacks with the historical measurement data and employ the captured features to detect the FDI attacks in real-time. By doing so, our proposed detection mechanism effectively relaxes the assumptions on the potential attack scenarios and achieves high accuracy. Furthermore, we propose an optimization model to characterize the behavior of one type of FDI attack that compromises the limited number of state measurements of the power system for electricity theft. We illustrate the performance of the proposed strategy through the simulation by using IEEE 118-bus test system. We also evaluate the scalability of our proposed detection mechanism by using IEEE 300-bus test system.

AB It is critical to secure the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices because of potentially devastating consequences in case of an attack. Machine learning (ML) and big data analytics are the two powerful leverages for analyzing and securing the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. By extension, these techniques can help improve the security of the IIoT systems as well. In this paper, we first present common IIoT protocols and their associated vulnerabilities. Then, we run a cyber-vulnerability assessment and discuss the utilization of ML in countering these susceptibilities. Following that, a literature review of the available intrusion detection solutions using ML models is presented. Finally, we discuss our case study, which includes details of a real-world testbed that we have built to conduct cyber-attacks and to design an intrusion detection system (IDS). We deploy backdoor, command injection, and Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attacks against the system and demonstrate how a ML-based anomaly detection system can perform well in detecting these attacks. We have evaluated the performance through representative metrics to have a fair point of view on the effectiveness of the methods.

AB A revolution in manufacturing systems is underway: substantial recent investment has been directed towards the development of smart manufacturing systems that are able to respond in real time to changes in customer demands, as well as the conditions in the supply chain and in the factory itself. Smart manufacturing is a key component of the broader thrust towards Industry 4.0, and relies on the creation of a bridge between digital and physical environments through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, coupled with enhancements to those digital environments through greater use of cloud systems, data analytics and machine learning. Whilst these individual technologies have been in development for some time, their integration with industrial systems leads to new challenges as well as potential benefits. In this paper, we explore the challenges faced by those wishing to secure smart manufacturing systems. Lessons from history suggest that where an attempt has been made to retrofit security on systems for which the primary driver was the development of functionality, there are inevitable and costly breaches. Indeed, today's manufacturing systems have started to experience this over the past few years; however, the integration of complex smart manufacturing technologies massively increases the scope for attack from adversaries aiming at industrial espionage and sabotage. The potential outcome of these attacks ranges from economic damage and lost production, through injury and loss of life, to catastrophic nation-wide effects. In this paper, we discuss the security of existing industrial and manufacturing systems, existing vulnerabilities, potential future cyber-attacks, the weaknesses of existing measures, the levels of awareness and preparedness for future security challenges, and why security must play a key role underpinning the development of future smart manufacturing systems.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM
AB Internet Industrial Control Systems (IICSs) that connect technological appliances and services with physical systems have become a new direction of research as they face different types of cyber-attacks that threaten their success in providing continuous services to organizations. Such threats cause firms to suffer financial and reputational losses and the stealing of important information. Although Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) have been proposed to protect against them, they have the difficult task of collecting information for use in developing an intelligent NIDS which can proficiently detect existing and new attacks. In order to address this challenge, this paper proposes an anomaly detection technique for IICSs based on deep learning models that can learn and validate using information collected from TCP/IP packets. It includes a consecutive training process executed using a deep auto-encoder and deep feedforward neural network architecture which is evaluated using two well-known network datasets, namely, the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. As the experimental results demonstrate that this technique can achieve a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than eight recently developed techniques, it could be implemented in real IICS environments.

AB Industrial Control System (ICS) is a general term that includes supervisory control & data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other control system configurations such as programmable logic controllers (PLC). ICSs are often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures, such as nuclear and thermal plants, water treatment facilities, power generation, heavy industries, and distribution systems. Though ICSs were kept isolated from the Internet for so long, significant achievable business benefits are driving a convergence between ICSs and the Internet as well as information technology (IT) environments, such as cloud computing. As a result, ICSs have been exposed to the attack vectors used in the majority of cyber-attacks. However, ICS devices are inherently much less secure against such advanced attack scenarios. A compromise to ICS can lead to enormous physical damage and danger to human lives. In this work, we have a close look at the shift of the ICS from stand-alone systems to cloud-based environments. Then we discuss the major works, from industry and academia towards the development of the secure ICSs, especially applicability of the machine learning techniques for the ICS cyber-security. The work may help to address the challenges of securing industrial processes, particularly while migrating them to the cloud environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, multi-sensor technologies are applied in many fields, e.g., Health Care (HC), Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and Industrial Control System (ICS). These sensors can generate a substantial amount of multivariate time-series data. Unsupervised anomaly detection on multi-sensor time-series data has been proven critical in machine learning researches. The key challenge is to discover generalized normal patterns by capturing spatial-temporal correlation in multi-sensor data. Beyond this challenge, the noisy data is often intertwined with the training data, which is likely to mislead the model by making it hard to distinguish between the normal, abnormal, and noisy data. Few of previous researches can jointly address these two challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based anomaly detection algorithm called Deep Convolutional Autoencoding Memory network (CAE-M). We first build a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder to characterize spatial dependence of multi-sensor data with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to better distinguish between the noisy, normal, and abnormal data. Then, we construct a Memory Network consisting of linear (Autoregressive Model) and non-linear predictions (Bidirectional LSTM with Attention) to capture temporal dependence from time-series data. Finally, CAE-M jointly optimizes these two subnetworks. We empirically compare the proposed approach with several state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods on HAR and HC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms these existing methods.

TI Securing Critical Infrastructures: Deep-Learning-Based Threat Detection
   in IIoT
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a physical information system developed based on traditional industrial control networks. As one of the most critical infrastructure systems, IIoT is also a preferred target for adversaries engaged in advanced persistent threats (APTs). To address this issue, we explore a deep-learning-based proactive APT detection scheme in IIoT. In this scheme, considering the characteristics of long attack sequences and long-term continuous APT attacks, our solution adopts a well-known deep learning model, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), to detect APT attack sequences. The APT attack sequence is also optimized to ensure the model's long-term sequence judgment effectiveness. The experimental results not only show that the proposed deep learning method has feasibility and effectiveness for APT detection, but also certify that the BERT model has better accuracy and a lower false alarm rate when detecting APT attack sequences than other time series models.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB The integration of communication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) in Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) increases their vulnerability towards cyber-attacks, causing devastating outcomes. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are mainly developed to support information technology systems, count vastly on predefined models and are trained mostly on specific cyber-attacks. Besides, most IDSs do not consider the imbalanced nature of ICS datasets, thereby suffering from low accuracy and high false-positive when being put to use. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to construct new balanced representations of the imbalanced datasets. The new representations are fed into an ensemble deep learning attack detection model specifically designed for an ICS environment. The proposed attack detection model leverages Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers to detect cyber-attacks from the new representations. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated based on 10-fold cross-validation on two real ICS datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), DNN, and AdaBoost, as well as recent existing models in the literature. The proposed approach is a generalized technique, which can be implemented in existing ICS infrastructures with minimum effort.

AB Unlike the existing research that focuses on detecting electricity theft cyber-attacks in the consumption domain, this paper investigates electricity thefts at the distributed generation (DG) domain. In this attack, malicious customers hack into the smart meters monitoring their renewable-based DG units and manipulate their readings to claim higher supplied energy to the grid and hence falsely overcharge the utility company. Deep machine learning is investigated to detect such a malicious behavior. We aim to answer three main questions in this paper: a) What are the cyber-attack functions that can be applied by malicious customers to the generation data in order to falsely overcharge the utility company? b) What sources of data can be used in order to detect these cyber-attacks by the utility company? c) Which deep machine learning-model should be used in order to detect these cyber-attacks? Our investigation revealed that integrating various data from the DG smart meters, meteorological reports, and SCADA metering points in the training of a deep convolutional-recurrent neural network offers the highest detection rate (99.3%) and lowest false alarm (0.22%).

AB Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are characterized by their ability to integrate the physical and information or cyber worlds. Their deployment in critical infrastructure have demonstrated a potential to transform the world. However, harnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and the far reaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment. An attraction for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending information from sensors to actuators over the wireless communication medium, thereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally, CPS security has been investigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access to the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most research work have therefore focused on the detection of attacks in CPS. However, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming more difficult to totally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making CPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain functional despite the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant methodologies explored for building resilient CPS is dependent on machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial ML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient. This article is therefore aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions between resilient CPS using ML and resilient ML when applied in CPS. The paper concludes with a number of research trends and promising future research directions. Furthermore, with this article, readers can have a thorough understanding of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS and countermeasures, as well as research trends in this active research area.

AB Industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used and vital to industry and society. Their failure can have severe impact on both the economy and human life. Hence, these systems have become an attractive target for physical and cyber attacks alike. In this article, we examine an attack detection method based on simple and lightweight neural networks, namely, 1D convolutional neural networks and autoencoders. We apply these networks to both the time and frequency domains of the data and discuss the pros and cons of each representation approach. The suggested method is evaluated on three popular public datasets, and detection rates matching or exceeding previously published detection results are achieved, while demonstrating a small footprint, short training and detection times, and generality. We also show the effectiveness of PCA, which, given proper data preprocessing and feature selection, can provide high attack detection rates in many settings. Finally, we study the proposed method's robustness against adversarial attacks that exploit inherent blind spots of neural networks to evade detection while achieving their intended physical effect. Our results show that the proposed method is robust to such evasion attacks: in order to evade detection, the attacker is forced to sacrifice the desired physical impact on the system.

AB Smart grids rely on SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems to monitor and control complex electrical networks in order to provide reliable energy to homes and industries. However, the increased inter-connectivity and remote accessibility of SCADA systems expose them to cyber attacks. As a consequence, developing effective security mechanisms is a priority in order to protect the network from internal and external attacks. We propose an integrated framework for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for smart grids which combines feature engineering-based preprocessing with machine learning classifiers. Whilst most of the machine learning techniques fine-tune the hyper-parameters to improve the detection rate, our approach focuses on selecting the most promising features of the dataset using Gradient Boosting Feature Selection (GBFS) before applying the classification algorithm, a combination which improves not only the detection rate but also the execution speed. GBFS uses the Weighted Feature Importance (WFI) extraction technique to reduce the complexity of classifiers. We implement and evaluate various decision-tree based machine learning techniques after obtaining the most promising features of the power grid dataset through a GBFS module, and show that this approach optimizes the False Positive Rate (FPR) and the execution time.

AB The proliferation and application of machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have allowed for more flexibility and efficiency in the automated detection of cyber attacks in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). However, the introduction of such IDSs has also created an additional attack vector; the learning models may also be subject to cyber attacks, otherwise referred to as Adversarial Machine Learning (AML). Such attacks may have severe consequences in ICS systems, as adversaries could potentially bypass the IDS. This could lead to delayed attack detection which may result in infrastructure damages, financial loss, and even loss of life. This paper explores how adversarial learning can be used to target supervised models by generating adversarial samples using the Jacobian-based Saliency Map attack and exploring classification behaviours. The analysis also includes the exploration of how such samples can support the robustness of supervised models using adversarial training. An authentic power system dataset was used to support the experiments presented herein. Overall, the classification performance of two widely used classifiers, Random Forest and J48, decreased by 6 and 11 percentage points when adversarial samples were present. Their performances improved following adversarial training, demonstrating their robustness towards such attacks.

AB In recent years, the rapid development and wide application of advanced technologies have profoundly impacted industrial manufacturing, leading to smart manufacturing (SM). However, the Industrial IoT (IIoT)-based manufacturing systems are now one of the top industries targeted by a variety of attacks. In this research, we propose detecting Cyberattacks in Industrial Control Systems using Anomaly Detection. An anomaly detection architecture for the IIoT-based SM is proposed to deploy one of the top most concerned networking technique -a Federated Learning architecture -that can detect anomalies for time series data typically running inside an industrial system. The architecture achieves higher detection performance compared to the current detection solution for time series data. It also shows the feasibility and efficiency to be deployed on top of edge computing hardware of an IIoT-based SM that can save 35% of bandwidth consumed in the transmission link between the edge and the cloud. At the expense, the architecture needs to trade off with the computing resource consumed at edge devices for implementing the detection task. However, findings in maximal CPU usage of 85% and average Memory usage of 37% make this architecture totally realizable in an IIoT-based SM. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Attack detection problems in industrial control systems (ICSs) are commonly known as a network traffic monitoring scheme for detecting abnormal activities. However, a network-based intrusion detection system can be deceived by attackers that imitate the system's normal activity. In this work, we proposed a novel solution to this problem based on measurement data in the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The proposed approach is called measurement intrusion detection system (MIDS), which enables the system to detect any abnormal activity in the system even if the attacker tries to conceal it in the system's control layer. A supervised machine learning model is generated to classify normal and abnormal activities in an ICS to evaluate the MIDS performance. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed is developed to simulate the power generation units and exploit the attack dataset. In the proposed approach, we applied several machine learning models on the dataset, which show remarkable performances in detecting the dataset's anomalies, especially stealthy attacks. The results show that the random forest is performing better than other classifier algorithms in detecting anomalies based on measured data in the testbed.

AB This paper presents the development of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system testbed used for cybersecurity research. The testbed consists of a water storage tank's control system, which is a stage in the process of water treatment and distribution. Sophisticated cyber-attacks were conducted against the testbed. During the attacks, the network traffic was captured, and features were extracted from the traffic to build a dataset for training and testing different machine learning algorithms. Five traditional machine learning algorithms were trained to detect the attacks: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and KNN. Then, the trained machine learning models were built and deployed in the network, where new tests were made using online network traffic. The performance obtained during the training and testing of the machine learning models was compared to the performance obtained during the online deployment of these models in the network. The results show the efficiency of the machine learning models in detecting the attacks in real time. The testbed provides a good understanding of the effects and consequences of attacks on real SCADA environments.

AB The increased use of Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSN) in a variety of different applications, including those that involve critical infrastructure, has meant that adequately protecting these systems has become a necessity. These cyber-physical systems improve the monitoring and control features of these systems but also introduce several security challenges. Intrusion detection is a convenient second line of defence in case of the failure of normal network security protocols. Anomaly detection is a branch of intrusion detection that is resource friendly and provides broader detection generality making it ideal for IWSN applications. These schemes can be used to detect abnormal changes in the environment where IWSNs are deployed. This paper presents a literature survey of the work done in the field in recent years focusing primarily on machine learning techniques. Major research gaps regarding the practical feasibility of these schemes are also identified from surveyed work and critical water infrastructure is discussed as a use case.

AB This paper presents a completely data-driven and machine-learning-based approach, in two stages, to first characterize and then forecast hourly water demand in the short term with applications of two different data sources: urban water demand (SCADA data) and individual customer water consumption (AMR data). In the first case, reliable forecasting can be used to optimize operations, particularly the pumping schedule, in order to reduce energy-related costs, while in the second case, the comparison between forecast and actual values may support the online detection of anomalies, such as smart meter faults, fraud or possible cyber-physical attacks. Results are presented for a real case: the water distribution network in Milan.

ID DEEP LEARNING APPROACH
AB Critical infrastructures, e.g., electricity generation and dispersal networks, chemical processing plants, and gas distribution, are governed and monitored by supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA). Detecting intrusion is a prevalent area of study for numerous years, and several intrusion detection systems have been suggested in the literature for cyber-physical systems and industrial control system (ICS). In recent years, the viruses seismic net, duqu, and flame against ICS attacks have caused tremendous damage to nuclear facilities and critical infrastructure in some countries. These intensified attacks have sounded the alarm for the security of the ICS in many countries. The challenge in constructing an intrusion detection framework is to deal with unbalanced intrusion datasets, i.e. when one class is signified by a lesser amount of instances (minority class). To this end, we outline an approach to deal with this issue and propose an anomaly detection method for the ICS. Our proposed approach uses a hybrid model that takes advantage of the anticipated and consistent nature of communication patterns that occur among ground devices in ICS setups. First, we applied some preprocessing techniques to standardize and scale the data. Second, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied to improve the process of anomaly detection. Third, we employed an edited nearest-neighbor rule algorithm to balance the dataset. Fourth, by using the Bloom filter, a signature database is created by noting the system for a specific period lacking the occurrence of abnormalities. Finally, to detect new attacks, we combined our package contents-level detection with another instance-based learner to make a hybrid method for anomaly detection. The experimental results with a real large-scale dataset generated from a gas pipeline SCADA system show that the proposed approach HML-IDS outperforms the benchmark models with an accuracy rate of 97%.

AB Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are the lifeline of a country. Therefore, the anomaly detection of ICS traffic is an important endeavor. This paper proposes a model based on a deep residual Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to prevent gradient explosion or gradient disappearance and guarantee accuracy. The developed methodology addresses two limitations: most traditional machine learning methods can only detect known network attacks and deep learning algorithms require a long time to train. The utilization of transfer learning under the modification of the existing residual CNN structure guarantees the detection of unknown attacks. One-dimensional ICS flow data are converted into two-dimensional grayscale images to take full advantage of the features of CNN. Results show that the proposed method achieves a high score and solves the time problem associated with deep learning model training. The model can give reliable predictions for unknown or differently distributed abnormal data through short-term training. Thus, the proposed model ensures the safety of ICSs and verifies the feasibility of transfer learning for ICS anomaly detection.

ID DETECTION SYSTEMS
AB Currently, expert systems and applied machine learning algorithms are widely used to automate network intrusion detection. In critical infrastructure applications of communication technologies, the interaction among various industrial control systems and the Internet environment intrinsic to the IoT technology makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Given the existence of the enormous network traffic in critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), traditional methods of machine learning implemented in network anomaly detection are inefficient. Therefore, recently developed machine learning techniques, with the emphasis on deep learning, are finding their successful implementations in the detection and classification of anomalies at both the network and host levels. This paper presents an ensemble method that leverages deep models such as the Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a meta-classifier (i.e., logistic regression) following the principle of stacked generalization. To enhance the capabilities of the proposed approach, the method utilizes a two-step process for the apprehension of network anomalies. In the first stage, data pre-processing, a Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) is employed for the feature engineering problem. In the second phase, a stacking ensemble learning approach is utilized for classification. The efficiency of the method disclosed in this work is tested on heterogeneous datasets, including data gathered in the IoT environment, namely IoT-23, LITNET-2020, and NetML-2020. The results of the evaluation of the proposed approach are discussed. Statistical significance is tested and compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in network anomaly detection.

AB Cyber threat attribution identifies the source of a malicious cyber activity, which in turn informs cyber security mitigation responses and strategies. Such responses and strategies are crucial for deterring future attacks, particularly in the financial and critical infrastructure sectors. However, existing approaches generally rely on manual analysis of attack indicators obtained through approaches such as trace-back, firewalls, intrusion detection and honeypot deployments. These attack indicators, also known as low-level Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), are rarely re-used and can be easily modified and disguised resulting in a deceptive and biased cyber threat attribution. Cyber attackers, particularly financially-motivated actors, can use common high-level attack patterns that evolve less frequently as compared to the low-level IOCs. To attribute cyber threats effectively, it is necessary to identify them based on the high-level adversary's attack patterns (e.g. tactics, techniques and procedures - TTPs, software tools and malware) employed in different phases of the cyber kill chain. Identification of high-level attack patterns is time-consuming, requiring forensic investigation of the victim network(s) and other resources. In the rare case that attack patterns are reported in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, the format is textual and unstructured typically taking the form of lengthy incident reports prepared for human consumption (e.g. prepared for C-level and senior management executives), which cannot be directly interpreted by machines. Thus, in this paper we propose a framework to automate cyber threat attribution. Specifically, we profile cyber threat actors (CTAs) based on their attack patterns extracted from CTI reports, using the distributional semantics technique of Natural Language Processing. Using these profiles, we train and test five machine learning classifiers on 327 CTI reports collected from publicly available incident reports that cover events from May 2012 to February 2018. It is observed that the CTA profiles obtained attribute cyber threats with a high precision (i.e. 83% as compared to other publicly available CTA profiles, where the precision is 33%). The Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) based classifier also attributes cyber threats with a higher accuracy (i.e. 94% as compared to other classifiers). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stealthy false data injection attacks target state estimation in energy management systems in smart power grids to adversely affect operations of the power transmission systems. This paper presents a data-driven machine learning based scheme to detect stealthy false data injection attacks on state estimation. The scheme employs ensemble learning, where multiple classifiers are used and decisions by individual classifiers are further classified. Two ensembles are used in this scheme, one uses supervised classifiers while the other uses unsupervised classifiers. The scheme is validated using simulated data on the standard IEEE 14-bus system. Experimental results show that the performance of both supervised individual and ensemble models are comparable. However, for unsupervised models, the ensembles performed better than the individual classifiers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), potential threats to smart manufacturing systems are increasingly becoming challenging, causing severe damage to production operations and vital industrial assets, even sensitive information. Hence, detecting irregularities for time-series data in industrial control systems that should operate continually is critical, ensuring security and minimizing maintenance costs. In this study, with the hybrid design of Federated learning, Autoencoder, Transformer, and Fourier mixing sublayer, we propose a robust distributed anomaly detection architecture that works more accurately than several most recent anomaly detection solutions within the ICS contexts, whilst being fast learning in minute time scale. This distributed architecture is also proven to achieve lightweight, consume little CPU and memory usage, have low communication costs in terms of bandwidth consumption, which makes it feasible to be deployed on top of edge devices with limited computing capacity.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Critical industrial infrastructures are currently facing increasing cyberspace threats in their underlying information and communication systems. The advanced monitoring, control, and management functionalities of the industrial systems firmly rely on the reliable and secure operations of the industrial control system (ICS) network. This article characterizes the ICS network traffic and presents a scalable and efficient solution for real-time ICS network traffic anomaly detection, considering various forms of ICS anomaly events. The events due to the cyberattacks, malicious operating behaviors, and network anomalies can be effectively detected without sophisticated computational requirements and retrieval of communication protocols. The proposed hybrid statistical-machine learning model integrates a seasonal autoregressive integration moving average (SARIMA)-based dynamic threshold model and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to jointly identify the abnormal traffic patterns with low false omission rates. The proposed solution is extensively evaluated at a realistic ICS cyber-physical system (CPS) testbed, and the numerical results confirm its high detection accuracy and low computational complexity.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Industrial Control Systems (ICS) consisting of integrated hardware and software components designed to monitor and control a variety of industrial processes, are typically deployed in critical infrastructures such as water treatment plants, power grids and gas pipelines. Unlike conventional IT systems, the consequences of deviations from normal operation in ICS have the potential to cause significant physical damage to equipment, the environment and even human life. The active monitoring of invariant rules that define the physical conditions that must be maintained for the normal operation of ICS provides a means to improve the security and dependability of such systems by which early detection of anomalous system states may be achieved, allowing for timely mitigating actions - such as fault checking, system shutdown - to be taken. Generally, invariant rules are predefined by system engineers during the design phase of a given ICS build. However, this manually intensive process is costly, error-prone and, in typically complex systems, sub-optimal. In this paper we propose a novel framework that is designed to systematically generate invariant rules from information contained within ICS operational data logs, using a combination of several machine learning and data mining techniques. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by experiments on two real world ICS testbeds: a water distribution system and a water treatment plant. We show that sets of invariant rules, far larger than those defined manually, can be successfully derived by our framework and that they may be used to deliver significant improvements in anomaly detection compared with the invariant rules defined by system engineers as well as the commonly used residual error-based anomaly detection model for ICS.

AB Contemporary Smart Power Systems (SPNs) depend on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to connect physical devices and control tools. Developing a robust privacy-conserving intrusion detection method involves network and physical data regarding the setups, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for defending real data and recognizing cyber-attacks. A key issue in the implementation of SPNs is the security against cyber-attacks, targeting to interrupt SCADA operations and violate data privacy over the usage of penetration and data poisoning attacks. In this paper, a privacy-conserving framework, so-called PC-IDS, is proposed for realizing the privacy and safety features of SPNs through hybrid machine learning approach. The framework includes two key components. Primarily, a data pre-processing component is proposed for cleaning and transforming actual data into a different layout that accomplishes the aim of privacy conservation. Then, an intrusion detection component is proposed using a particle swarm optimization-based probabilistic neural network for the identification and recognition of malicious events. The performance of PC-IDS framework is evaluated by means of two commonly available datasets, i.e. the Power System and UNSW-NB15 datasets. The experimental outcomes highlight that the framework can proficiently protect data of SPNs and determine anomalous behaviours compared to numerous recent compelling state-of-the-art methods with respect to false positive rate (FPR), detection rate (DR) and computational processing time (CPT) by achieving 96.03% of DR, 0.18% FPR for Power System dataset and 95.91% of DR, 0.14% FPR for UNSW-NB15 dataset.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB In recent decades, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have been affected by heterogeneous cyberattacks that have a huge impact on the physical world and the people's safety. Nowadays, the techniques achieving the best performance in the detection of cyber anomalies are based on Machine Learning and, more recently, Deep Learning. Due to the incipient stage of cybersecurity research in ICS, the availability of datasets enabling the evaluation of anomaly detection techniques is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a methodology to generate reliable anomaly detection datasets in ICS that consists of four steps: attacks selection, attacks deployment, traffic capture and features computation. The proposed methodology has been used to generate the Electra Dataset, whose main goal is the evaluation of cybersecurity techniques in an electric traction substation used in the railway industry. Using the Electra dataset, we train several Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to detect anomalies in ICS and the performed experiments show that the models have high precision and, therefore, demonstrate the suitability of our dataset for use in production systems.

AB The constant miniaturization of hardware and an increase in power efficiency, have made possible the integration of intelligence into ordinary devices. This trend of augmenting so-called non- intelligent everyday devices with computational capabilities has led to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. With a wide variety of applications, such as home automation, smart grids/cities, and critical infrastructure management, the IoT systems make compelling targets for cyber-attacks. In order to effectively compromise these systems, adversaries employ different advanced persistent threat (APT) methods, with one such sophisticated method, being botnets. By employing a plethora of infected machines (bots), attackers manage to compromise the IoT systems and exploit them. Prior to the appearance of the IoT domain, specialized digital forensics mechanisms were developed, in order to investigate Botnet activities in small-scale systems. Since IoT enabled botnets are scalable, technologically diverse and make use of current high-speed networks, developing forensic mechanisms capable of investigating the IoT Botnet activities has become an important challenge in the cyber-security field. Various studies have proposed, deep learning as a viable solution for handling the IoT generated data, as it was designed to handle diverse data in large volumes, requiring near real-time processing. In this study, we provide a review of forensics and deep learning mechanisms employed to investigate botnets and their applicability in the IoT environments. We provide a new definition for the IoT, in addition to a taxonomy of network forensic solutions, that were developed for both conventional, as well as, the IoT settings. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability of deep learning in network forensics, the inherent challenges of applying network forensics techniques to the IoT, and provide future direction for research in this field.

AB Machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection system (IDS) approaches have been significantly applied and advanced the state-of-the-art system security and defense mechanisms. In smart grid computing environments, security threats have been significantly increased as shared networks are commonly used, along with the associated vulnerabilities. However, compared to other network environments, ML-based IDS research in a smart grid is relatively unexplored, although the smart grid environment is facing serious security threats due to its unique environmental vulnerabilities. In this article, we conducted an extensive survey on ML-based IDS in smart grids based on the following key aspects: (1) The applications of the ML-based IDS in transmission and distribution side power components of a smart power grid by addressing its security vulnerabilities; (2) dataset generation process and its usage in applying ML-based IDSs in the smart grid; (3) a wide range of ML-based IDSs used by the surveyed papers in the smart grid environment; (4) metrics, complexity analysis, and evaluation testbeds of the IDSs applied in the smart grid; and (5) lessons learned, insights, and future research directions.

AB Industrial automation and control systems (IACS) are tremendously employing supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network. However, their integration into IACS is vulnerable to various cyber-attacks. In this article, we first present population extremal optimization (PEO)-based deep belief network detection method (PEO-DBN) to detect the cyber-attacks of SCADA-based IACS. In PEO-DBN method, PEO algorithm is employed to determine the DBN's parameters, including number of hidden units and the size of mini-batch and learning rate, as there is no clear knowledge to set these parameters. Then, to enhance the performance of single method for cyber-attacks detection, the ensemble learning scheme is introduced for aggregation of the proposed PEO-DBN method, called EnPEO-DBN. The proposed detection methods are evaluated on gas pipeline system dataset and water storage tank system dataset from SCADA network traffic by comparing with some existing methods. Through performance analysis, simulation results show the superiority of PEO-DBN and EnPEO-DBN.

AB Despite its technological benefits, the Internet of Things (IoT) has cyber weaknesses due to vulnerabilities in the wireless medium. Machine Laming (ML)-based methods are widely used against cyber threats in IoT networks with promising performance. An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is prominent for cybercriminals to compromise networks, and it is crucial to long-term and harmful characteristics. However, it is difficult to apply ML-based approaches to identify APT attacks to obtain a promising detection performance due to an extremely small percentage among normal traffic. There are limited surveys that fully investigate AFT attacks in IoT networks due to the lack of public datasets with all types of APT attacks. It is worth bridging the state of the art in network attack detection with APT attack detection in a comprehensive review article. This survey article reviews the security challenges in IoT networks and presents well-known attacks, APT attacks, and threat models in IoT systems. Meanwhile, signature-based, anomaly-based, and hybrid intrusion detection systems are summarized for IoT networks. The article highlights statistical insights regarding frequently applied ML-based methods against network intrusion. Finally, open issues and challenges for common network intrusion and APT attacks are presented for future research.

AB Currently, most anomaly detection approaches in industrial control systems (ICSs) use network event logs to build models, and current unsupervised machine learning methods rarely use spatiotemporal correlations and other dependencies between multiple variables (sensors/actuators) in a system to detect anomalies. Most of the existing anomaly detection technologies simply compare the current states with the predicted normal range. Due to the highly dynamic characteristic of industrial control systems, it is insufficient to simply compare the current states with the predicted normal range. As a result, these approaches have low detection rates for unknown or new types of attacks. In view of these shortcomings, this paper presents a network model for predicting sensor/controller parameters in industrial control systems. To predict the parameter values of the sensors and controllers more accurately, the 1D convolutional neural network (1D & x005F;CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are combined to fully learn the spatiotemporal correlation and other dependencies between the parameter values of the sensors and controllers at each moment. An abnormal state detection method based on the calculation of the statistical deviation is proposed to realize the anomaly detection of industrial control systems. The model is validated on the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset. The precision, recall and F1 scores are used to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in anomaly detection on the SWaT dataset. The experimental results show that the average precision and recall of this method are 0.99 and 0.85, respectively, and that the average F1 score is 0.91. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be successfully applied to anomaly detection systems in industrial control systems with lower false positive rates.

AB The digitalization of power systems over the past decade has made the cybersecurity of substations a top priority for regulatory agencies and utilities. Proprietary communication protocols are being increasingly replaced by standardized and interoperable protocols providing utility operators with remote access and control capabilities at the expense of growing cyberattack risks. In particular, the potential of supply chain cyberattacks is on the rise in industrial control systems. In this environment, there is a pressing need for the development of cyberattack detection systems for substations and in particular protective relays, a critical component of substation operation. This article presents a deep learning-based cyberattack detection system for transmission line protective relays. The proposed cyberattack detection system is first trained with current and voltage measurements representing various types of faults on the transmission lines. The cyberattack detection system is then employed to detect current and voltage measurements that are maliciously injected by an attacker to trigger the transmission line protective relays. The proposed cyberattack detection system is evaluated under a variety of cyberattack scenarios. The results demonstrate that a universal architecture can be designed for the deep learning-based cyberattack detection systems in substations.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Methods from machine learning are used in the design of secure Industrial Control Systems. Such methods focus on two major areas: detection of intrusions at the network level using the information acquired through network packets, and detection of anomalies at the physical process level using data that represents the physical behavior of the system. This survey focuses on four types of methods from machine learning for intrusion and anomaly detection, namely, supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The literature available in the public domain was carefully selected, analyzed, and placed along a 10-dimensional space for ease of comparison. This multi-dimensional approach is found valuable in the comparison of the methods considered and enables a scientific discussion on their utility in specific environments. The challenges associated in using machine learning, and gaps in research, are identified and recommendations made.

AB Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are sustainable solutions to water scarcity. As initial conditions offered to WWTPs, influent conditions (ICs) affect treatment units states, ongoing processes mechanisms, and product qualities. Anomalies in ICs, often raised by abnormal events, need to be monitored and detected promptly to improve system resilience and provide smart environments. This paper proposed and verified data-driven anomaly detection approaches based on deep learning methods and clustering algorithms. Combining both the ability to capture temporal auto-correlation features among multivariate time series from recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and the function to delineate complex distributions from restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), RNN-RBM models were employed and connected with various classifiers for anomaly detection. The effectiveness of RNN based, RBM based, RNN-RBM based, or standalone individual detectors, including expectation maximization clustering, K-means clustering, mean-shift clustering, one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), spectral clustering, and agglomerative clustering algorithms were evaluated by importing seven years ICs data from a coastal municipal WWTP where more than 150 abnormal events occurred. Results demonstrated that RNN-RBM-based OCSVM approach outperformed all other scenarios with an area under the curve value up to 0.98, which validated the superiority in feature extraction by RNN-RBM, and the robustness in multivariate nonlinear kernels by OCSVM. The model was flexible for not requiring assumptions on data distribution, and could be shared and transferred among environmental data scientists.

AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have become ubiquitous in recent years and has become the core of modern critical infrastructure and industrial applications. Therefore, ensuring security is a prime concern. Due to the success of Deep Learning (DL) in a multitude of domains, development of DL based CPS security applications have received increased interest in the past few years. Developing generalized models is critical since the models have to perform well under threats that they havent trained on. However, despite the broad body of work on using DL for ensuring the security of CPSs, to our best knowledge very little work exists where the focus is on the generalization capabilities of these DL applications. In this paper, we intend to provide a concise survey of the regularization methods for DL algorithms used in security-related applications in CPSs and thus could be used to improve the generalization capability of DL based cyber-physical system based security applications. Further, we provide a brief insight into the current challenges and future directions as well.

ID DETECTION SYSTEM
AB In this article, we investigate deep-learning-based omni intrusion detection system (IDS) for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks that are capable of detecting both temporally uncorrelated and correlated attacks. Regarding the IDSs developed in this article, a feedforward neural network (FNN) can detect temporally uncorrelated attacks at an F1 of 99.9670.005 but correlated attacks as low as 582. In contrast, long short-term memory (LSTM) detects correlated attacks at 99.560.01 while uncorrelated attacks at 99.30.1. Combining LSTM and FNN through an ensemble approach further improves the IDS performance with F1 of 99.680.04 regardless the temporal correlations among the data packets.

AB The massive modern technical revolution in electronics, cognitive computing, and sensing has provided critical infrastructure for the development of today's Internet of Things (IoT) for a wide range of applications. However, because endpoint devices' computing, storage, and communication capabilities are limited, IoT infrastructures are exposed to a wide range of cyber-attacks. As such, Darknet or blackholes (sinkholes) attacks are significant, and recent attack vectors that are launched against several IoT communication services. Since Darknet address space evolved as a reserved internet address space that is not contemplated to be used by legitimate hosts globally, any communication traffic is speculated to be unsolicited and distinctively deemed a probe, backscatter, or misconfiguration. Thus, in this paper, we develop, investigate, and evaluate the performance of machine-learning-based Darknet traffic detection systems (DTDS) in IoT networks. Mainly, we make use of six supervised machine-learning techniques, including bagging decision tree ensembles (BAG-DT), AdaBoost decision tree ensembles (ADA-DT), RUSBoosted decision tree ensembles (RUS-DT), optimizable decision tree (O-DT), optimizable k-nearest neighbor (O-KNN), and optimizable discriminant (O-DSC). We evaluate the implemented DTDS models on a recent and comprehensive dataset, known as the CIC-Darknet-2020 dataset, composed of contemporary actual IoT communication traffic involving four different classes that combine VPN and Tor traffic in a single dataset covering a wide range of captured cyber-attacks and hidden services provided by the Darknet. Our empirical performance analysis demonstrates that bagging ensemble techniques (BAG-DT) offer better accuracy and lower error rates than other implemented supervised learning techniques, scoring a 99.50% of classification accuracy with a low inferencing overhead of 9.09 mu second. Finally, we also contrast our BAG-DT-DTDS with other existing DTDS models and demonstrate that our best results are improved by (1.9~27%) over the former state-of-the-art models.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing cyber security solutions for fog-based smart grid SCADA systems. We start by providing an overview of the architecture and the concept of fog-based smart grid SCADA systems and its main components. According to security requirements and vulnerabilities, we provide a classification of these solutions into four categories, including authentication solutions, privacy-preserving solutions, key management systems, and intrusion detection systems. For each category, we describe the essence of the methods and provide a classification with respect to security requirements. Therefore, according to the machine learning methods used by the intrusion detection system (IDS), we classify the IDS solutions into nine categories, including deep learning-based IDS, artificial neural networks-based IDS, support vector machine-based IDS, decision tree-based IDS, rule-based IDS, Bloom filter-based IDS, random forest-based IDS, random subspace learning-based IDS, and deterministic finite automaton-based IDS. The informal and formal security analysis techniques used by the cyber security solutions are tabulated and summarized. In addition, we provide a taxonomy of attacks tackled by privacy-preserving and authentication solutions in the form of tables. Based on the present study, several proposals for challenges and research issues such as detecting false data injection attacks are discussed at the end of the paper. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT), as the information carrier of the Internet and telecommunications networks, is a new network technology comprising physical entities embedded with electronic components, software and sensors, and characterized by strong complexity and openness. With the massive amount of data, the occurrence of network intrusion is also increasingly frequent, involving industrial control systems, IoT devices, mobile security, cloud services, and telecommunications services. With the diversification and intelligence of cyberattack behaviors, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) face problems-such as insufficient feature extraction and inaccurate model classification-when faced with high-dimensional features and nonlinear massive data. Due to their powerful data representation learning ability, deep learning methods save substantial time in processing high-dimensional and complex intrusion data. On this basis, we propose an intrusion detection model using ResNet, Transformer and BiLSTM (Res-TranBiLSTM) that takes into account both the spatial and temporal features of network traffic. We use the Synthetic Minor Overriding Technique (SMOTE) - Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) method to alleviate the degree of data imbalance. In addition, we respectively establish a spatial feature extraction model based on ResNet and a temporal feature extraction model based on Transformer and BiLSTM to extract spatial features and temporal features parallelly. Finally, spatiotemporal features are included to achieve attack detection and classification. Further, simulation experiments are conducted using the public data sets NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017. The experiments are implemented using Python programming language and Pytorch framework. The results reveal that the performance of our proposed model is better than that of other models, with accuracy reaching 90.99%, 99.15% and 99.56%, on NSL-KDD dataset, CIC-IDS2017 dataset and MQTTset dataset, respectively. It increased the detection accuracy by about 1%-10% on NSL-KDD dataset and about 0.2%-10% on CIC-IDS2017 dataset, and about 1%-10% on MQTTset dataset. These results demonstrate that this method is effective in constructing and optimizing large-scale IDS in the IoT environment.

AB The Internet of Things era is being replaced by the Internet of Everything (IoE) era, where everything can communicate with everything else. With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution and the IoE era, industrial control systems (ICSs) are transitioning into industrial IoE (IIoE). The ICS, which is no longer a closed network, suffers from various cybersecurity threats. Since the attack of Stuxnet in 2010, the malware used to attack critical infrastructure (CI) has become increasingly sophisticated. Furthermore, recent attacks have mimicked normal network traffic. Therefore, investigating intrusion detection systems is necessary to detect these advanced cyberattacks. However, detecting advanced attacks, such as false data injection, is difficult because the traditional detection methods focus only on the protocol header fields. Most studies have not considered low-performance field devices, which are vulnerable to threats. Therefore, we have classified the extended reference model RAMI 4.0, which is the new ICS reference model in the fourth industrial revolution, into two levels: an operative level and a product process management level. A fast and lightweight algorithm is required at the operative level because the low-performance devices communicate with each other in real time. In addition, efficient data processing is important because considerable amount of data is concentrated at the product process management level. Based on these characteristics, a payload-based abnormal behavior detection method, i.e., the autoencoder-based payload anomaly detection (APAD), is proposed for each level. APAD uses an autoencoder to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors in low-performance devices. Furthermore, traffic analysis and a considerable amount of time are required to apply a traditional detection method at the product process management level. However, the proposed method does not require long-time traffic analysis. It exhibits a higher detection rate compared with those exhibited by other methods based on verification using the open secure water treatment dataset called SWaT. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Attacks on industrial enterprises are increasing in number as well as in effect. Since the introduction of industrial control systems in the 1970's, industrial networks have been the target of malicious actors. More recently, the political and warfare-aspects of attacks on industrial and critical infrastructure are becoming more relevant. In contrast to classic home and office IT systems, industrial IT, so-called OT systems, have an effect on the physical world. Furthermore, industrial devices have long operation times, sometimes several decades. Updates and fixes are tedious and often not possible. The threats on industry with the legacy requirements of industrial environments creates the need for efficient intrusion detection that can be integrated into existing systems. In this work, the network data containing industrial operation is analysed with machine learning- and time series-based anomaly detection algorithms in order to discover the attacks introduced to the data. Two different data sets are used, one Modbus-based gas pipeline control traffic and one OPC UA-based batch processing traffic. In order to detect attacks, two machine learning-based algorithms are used, namely SVM and Random Forest. Both perform well, with Random Forest slightly outperforming SVM. Furthermore, extracting and selecting features as well as handling missing data is addressed in this work.

AB Anomaly detection has been known as an effective technique to detect faults or cyber-attacks in industrial control systems (ICS). Therefore, many anomaly detection models have been proposed for ICS. However, most models have been implemented and evaluated under specific circumstances, which leads to confusion about choosing the best model in a real-world situation. In other words, there still needs to be a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art anomaly detection models with common experimental configurations. To address this problem, we conduct a comparative study of five representative time series anomaly detection models: InterFusion, RANSynCoder, GDN, LSTM-ED, and USAD. We specifically compare the performance analysis of the models in detection accuracy, training, and testing times with two publicly available datasets: SWaT and HAI. The experimental results show that the best model results are inconsistent with the datasets. For SWaT, InterFusion achieves the highest F1-score of 90.7% while RANSynCoder achieves the highest F1-score of 82.9% for HAI. We also investigate the effects of the training set size on the performance of anomaly detection models. We found that about 40% of the entire training set would be sufficient to build a model producing a similar performance compared to using the entire training set.

AB The power grid is considered to be the most critical piece of infrastructure in the United States because each of the other fifteen critical infrastructures, as defined by the Cyber-security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), require the energy sector to properly function. Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.

ID DEEP LEARNING APPROACH
AB Advances in communication and networking technology leads to the use of internet-based technology in Industrial Control System (ICS) applications. Simultaneously to the advantages and flexibility, it also opens doors to the attackers. Increased attacks on ICS are clear examples for the need of developing strong security mechanisms to develop defense in depth strategies for industries. Despite several techniques, every day a novel attack is being identified and this highlights the importance and need of robust techniques for identifying those attacks. Deep learning-based intrusion detection mechanisms are proven to be efficient in identifying novel attacks. Deep learning techniques such as Stacked Autoencoders (SAE), Deep Belief Networks (DBN) are widely used for intrusion detection but the research on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is limited. In this paper, the efficiency of CNN based intrusion detection for identifying the multiple attack classes using datasets such as NSLKDD and UNSW-NB 15 is evaluated. Different performance metrics such as precision, recall and F-measure were calculated and compared with the existing deep learning approaches.

ID SYSTEM
AB Smart Grid (SG) systems are critical, intelligent infrastructure utility services connected through open networks that are potentially susceptible to cyber-attacks with very acute security risks of shutdown, loss of life, and loss of revenue. Traditional intrusion detection systems based on signature and anomaly techniques are no longer sufficient to protect SGs due to their new connectivity and management challenges, the ever-rapidly-evolving masquerades, and cyber criminality levied against them. SGs require cyber-security systems to render them resilient and protected through advanced Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) techniques and mechanisms. This paper proposes a smart collaborative advanced IDPS to provide the best possible protection of SGs with a fully distributed management structure that supports the network and host based detections and the prevention of attacks. By facilitating a reliable, scalable, and flexible design, the specific requirements of IDPS for SGs can be more easily met via a fuzzy risk analyzer, an independent and ontology knowledge based inference engine module. These can work collaboratively by managing functions across multiple IDPS domains. A set of extensive and intensive simulated experiments shows that with its smart advanced components incorporating soft computing machine-learning techniques and a rich ontology knowledge base with fuzzy logic analysis, it detects and prevents intrusions more efficiently. The multi-faceted results of the simulation also show that the proposed Collaborative Smart IDPS (CSIDPS) system increases the intrusion detection accuracy and decreases the false positive alarms when compared to traditional IDPSs. This is epitomized by the skillful use of the confusion matrix technique for organizing classifiers, visualizing their performance, and assessing their overall behavior. In the final analysis, the CSIDPS architecture is designed toward contributing to de facto norms for SG ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An attack detection scheme is proposed to detect data integrity attacks on sensors in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). A combined fingerprint for sensor and process noise is created during the normal operation of the system. Under sensor spoofing attack, noise pattern deviates from the fingerprinted pattern enabling the proposed scheme to detect attacks. To extract the noise (difference between expected and observed value) a representative model of the system is derived. A Kalman filter is used for the purpose of state estimation. By subtracting the state estimates from the real system states, a residual vector is obtained. It is shown that in steady state the residual vector is a function of process and sensor noise. A set of time domain and frequency domain features is extracted from the residual vector. Feature set is provided to a machine learning algorithm to identify the sensor and process. Experiments are performed on two testbeds, a real-world water treatment (SWaT) facility and a water distribution (WADI) testbed. A class of zero-alarm attacks, designed for statistical detectors on SWaT are detected by the proposed scheme. It is shown that a multitude of sensors can be uniquely identified with accuracy higher than 90% based on the noise fingerprint.

TI Firefly algorithm based WSN-IoT security enhancement with machine
   learning for intrusion detection
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID DETECTION SYSTEM
AB A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) aided by the Internet of Things (IoT) is a collaborative system of WSN systems and IoT networks are work to exchange, gather, and handle data. The primary objective of this collaboration is to enhance data analysis and automation to facilitate improved decision-making. Securing IoT with the assistance of WSN necessitates the implementation of protective measures to confirm the safety and reliability of the interconnected WSN and IoT components. This research significantly advances the current state of the art in IoT and WSN security by synergistically harnessing the potential of machine learning and the Firefly Algorithm. The contributions of this work are twofold: firstly, the proposed FA-ML technique exhibits an exceptional capability to enhance intrusion detection accuracy within the WSN-IoT landscape. Secondly, the amalgamation of the Firefly Algorithm and machine learning introduces a novel dimension to the domain of security-oriented optimization techniques. The implications of this research resonate across various sectors, ranging from critical infrastructure protection to industrial automation and beyond, where safeguarding the integrity of interconnected systems are of paramount importance. The amalgamation of cutting-edge machine learning and bio-inspired algorithms marks a pivotal step forward in crafting robust and intelligent security measures for the evolving landscape of IoT-driven technologies. For intrusion detection in the WSN-IoT, the FA-ML method employs a support vector machine (SVM) machine model for classification with parameter tuning accomplished using a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm. The experimental evaluation is simulated using NSL-KDD Dataset, revealing the remarkable enhancement of the FA-ML technique, achieving a maximum accuracy of 99.34%. In comparison, the KNN-PSO and XGBoost models achieved lower accuracies of 96.42% and 95.36%, respectively. The findings validate the potential of the FA-ML technique as an active security solution for WSN-IoT systems, harnessing the power of machine learning and the Firefly Algorithm to bolster intrusion detection capabilities.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION
AB The threat to critical water system infrastructure has increased in recent years as is evident from the increasing number of reported attacks against these systems. Preventative security mechanisms are often not enough to keep attackers out so a second layer of security in the form of intrusion detection is paramount in order to limit the damage of successful attacks. In this paper several traditional anomaly detection techniques are evaluated in the context of attack detection in water distribution systems. These algorithms were centrally trained on the entire feature space and compared to multi-stage detection techniques that were designed to isolate both local and global anomalies. A novel ensemble technique that combines density-based and parametric algorithms was also developed and tested in the application environment. The traditional techniques had comparable results to the multi-stage systems and when used in conjunction with a local anomaly detector the performances of these algorithms were greatly improved. The developed ensemble technique also had promising results outperforming the density-based techniques and having comparable results to the parametric algorithms.

AB Machine learning algorithms have been shown to be suitable for securing platforms for IT systems. However, due to the fundamental differences between the industrial internet of things (IIoT) and regular IT networks, a special performance review needs to be considered. The vulnerabilities and security requirements of IIoT systems demand different considerations. In this paper, we study the reasons why machine learning must be integrated into the security mechanisms of the IIoT, and where it currently falls short in having a satisfactory performance. The challenges and real-world considerations associated with this matter are studied in our experimental design. We use an IIoT testbed resembling a real industrial plant to show our proof of concept.

AB The advent of Industry 4.0 has led to a rapid increase in cyber attacks on industrial systems and processes, particularly on Industrial Control Systems (ICS). These systems are increasingly becoming prime targets for cyber criminals and nation-states looking to extort large ransoms or cause disruptions due to their ability to cause devastating impact whenever they cease working or malfunction. Although myriads of cyber attack detection systems have been proposed and developed, these detection systems still face many challenges that are typically not found in traditional detection systems. Motivated by the need to better understand these challenges to improve current approaches, this paper aims to (1) understand the current vulnerability landscape in ICS, (2) survey current advancements of Machine Learning (ML) based methods with respect to the usage of ML base classifiers (3) provide insights to benefits and limitations of recent advancement with respect to two performance vectors; detection accuracy and attack variety. Based on our findings, we present key open challenges which will represent exciting research opportunities for the research community.

AB We are now witnessing the rapid growth of advanced technologies and their application, leading to Smart Manufacturing (SM). The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the main technologies used to enable smart factories, which is connecting all industrial assets, including machines and control systems, with the information systems and the business processes. Industrial Control Systems of smart IoT-based factories are one of the top industries attacked by numerous threats, especially unknown and novel attacks. As a result, with the distributed structure of plenty of IoT front-end sensing devices in SM, an effectively distributed anomaly detection (AD) architecture for IoT-based ICSs should: achieve high detection performance, train and learn new data patterns in a fast time scale, and have lightweight to be deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To date, most solutions for anomaly detection have not fulfilled all of these requirements. In addition, the interpretability of why an instance is predicted to be abnormal is hardly concerned. In this paper, we propose the so- called FedeX architecture to address those challenges. The experiments show that FedeX outperforms 14 other existing anomaly detection solutions on all detection metrics with the liquid storage data set. And with Recall of 1 and F1-score of 0.9857, it also outperforms those solutions on the SWAT data set. FedeX is also proven to be fast in terms of training time of about 7.5 minutes and lightweight in terms of hardware requirement with memory consumption of 14%, allowing us to deploy anomaly detection tasks on top of edge computing infrastructure and in real-time. Besides, FedeX is considered as one of the frameworks at the forefront of interpreting the predicted anomalies by using XAI, which enables experts to make quick decisions and trust the model more.

AB Smart manufacturing (SM) systems utilize run-time data to improve productivity via intelligent decision-making and analysis mechanisms on both machine and system levels. The increased adoption of cyber-physical systems in SM leads to the comprehensive framework of cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS) where data-enabled decision-making mechanisms are coupled with cyber-physical resources on the plant floor. Due to their cyber-physical nature, CPMS are susceptible to cyber-attacks that may cause harm to the manufacturing system, products, or even the human workers involved in this context. Therefore, detecting cyber-attacks efficiently and timely is a crucial step toward implementing and securing high-performance CPMS in practice. This paper addresses two key challenges to CPMS cyber-attack detection. The first challenge is distinguishing expected anomalies in the system from cyber-attacks. The second challenge is the identification of cyber-attacks during the transient response of CPMS due to closed-loop controllers. Digital twin (DT) technology emerges as a promising solution for providing additional insights into the physical process (twin) by leveraging run-time data, models, and analytics. In this work, we propose a DT framework for detecting cyber-attacks in CPMS during controlled transient behavior as well as expected anomalies of the physical process. We present a DT framework and provide details on structuring the architecture to support cyber-attack detection. Additionally, we present an experimental case study on off-the-shelf 3D printers to detect cyber-attacks utilizing the proposed DT framework to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Note to Practitioners-This work is motivated by developing a general-purpose and extensible digital twin-enabled cyber-attack detection framework for manufacturing systems. Existing works in the field consider specialized attack scenarios and models that may not be extensible in practical manufacturing scenarios. We utilize digital twin (DT) technology as a key enabler to develop a systematic and extensible framework where we identify the abnormality of a resource and detect if the abnormality is due to an attack or an expected anomaly. We provide several remarks on how our proposed framework can extend existing industrial control systems (ICS) and can accommodate further extensions. The presented DTs utilize data-driven machine learning models, physics-based models, and subject matter expert knowledge to perform detection and differentiation tasks in the context of expected anomalies and model-based controllers that control the manufacturing process between multiple setpoints. We utilize a model predictive controller on an off-the-shelf 3D printer to run the process, and stage anomalies and cyber-attacks that are successfully detected by the proposed framework.

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems supervise and monitor critical infrastructures and industrial processes. However, SCADA systems running on conventional network architecture have scalability and manageability limitations. Through its programmable dynamic architecture, Software Defined Network (SDN) technology offers rapid configuration, scalability, and better manageability for SCADA systems. Combining existing SCADA systems with SDN has produced more practical SDN-based SCADA systems. However, due to their sensitive positions, SCADA systems are the targets of highly dangerous cyberattacks. In particular, failure to accurately detect and take action against cyberattacks like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) may lead to service disruption in SDN-based SCADA systems which may cause loss of life or massive financial losses. This study suggested the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classifier model, including two separate parallel deep learning-based methods, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), to better the detection of DDoS attacks targeting SDN-based SCADA systems. The proposed parallel structure was trained from end to end with a training dataset and tested with the validation dataset. This model was processed in the transfer learning procedure. The features were extracted with the training dataset, and the extracted features were classified with Support Vector Machines (SVM). While in transfer learning, the validation data was used in feature extraction and obtained features were classified with a trained SVM classifier. As part of the work, a sample dataset containing both DDoS attacks and regular network traffic data was created using an experimentally generated SDN-based SCADA topology. While experimental works yielded an accuracy of 97.62% for DDoS attack detection, transfer learning allowed a performance improvement of around 5%. The results have shown that the proposed RNN deep learning classifier model can effectively detect DDoS attacks targeting SDNbased SCADA systems.

AB Operation anomalies are common phenomena in large-scale solar farms. Effective anomaly detection and classification is essential for improving operation reliability and electricity generation. However, this is a challenging task due to the high complexity and wide variety of frequently occurring anomalies. Furthermore, existing preinstalled supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA) can only provide a limited amount of information regarding the healthy condition of solar farms, making accurate anomaly detection and classification difficult. This paper presents a data-driven anomaly detection and classification solution, which can accurately detect and classify diverse photovoltaic system anomalies. The proposed solution does not require additional equipment or non-SCADA data collection. More specifically, the proposed work consists of two methods: 1) a hierarchical context-aware anomaly detection method using unsupervised learning; and 2) a multimodal anomaly classification method. The proposed solution has been deployed in two large-scale solar farms (39.36 and 21.62 MWp). Multimonth operation demonstrates the effectiveness, robustness, and cost and computation efficiency of the proposed solution.

AB During its nascent stages, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) were made robust to sustain tough industrial environments, but little care was taken to raise defenses against potential cyberthreats. The recent interconnectivity of legacy PLCs and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems with corporate networks and the Internet has significantly increased the threats to critical infrastructure. To counter these threats, researchers have put their efforts in finding defense mechanisms that can protect the SCADA network and the PLCs. Encryption and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) have been used by many organizations to protect data and the network against cyber-attacks. However, since PLC vendors do not make available information about their hardware or software, it becomes challenging for researchers to embed security mechanisms into their devices. This letter describes an alternative design using an open source PLC that was modified to encrypt all data it sends over the network, independently of the protocol used. Additionally, a machine learning-based IPS was added to the PLC network stack providing a secure mechanism against network flood attacks like denial of service (DoS). Experimental results indicated that the encryption layer and the IPS increased the security of the link between the PLC and the supervisory software, preventing interception, injection, and DoS attacks.

AB Anomaly detection is one of the biggest issues of security in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to the increase in cyber attack dangers for distributed devices and critical infrastructure networks. To face these challenges, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is suggested as a robust mechanism to protect and monitor malicious activities in IIoT networks. In this work, we suggest a new mechanism to improve the efficiency and robustness of the IDS system using Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We aim to develop realistic and equilibrated distribution for a given feature set using artificial data in order to overcome the issue of data imbalance. We show how the GAN can efficiently assist the distributional RL-based-IDS in enhancing the detection of minority attacks. To assess the taxonomy of our approach, we verified the effectiveness of our algorithm by using the Distributed Smart Space Orchestration System (DS2OS) dataset. The performance of the normal DRL and DRL-GAN models in binary and multiclass classifications was evaluated based on anomaly detection datasets. The proposed models outperformed the normal DRL in the standard metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We demonstrated that the GAN introduced in the training process of DRL with the aim of improving the detection of a specific class of data achieves the best results.

AB Deep Learning is emerging as an effective technique to detect sophisticated cyber-attacks targeting Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). The conventional detection approach is to learn the "normal" behaviour of the system, to be then able to label noteworthy deviations from it as anomalies. However, the normal behaviour of ICSs continuously evolves over time for multiple reasons, such as update/replacement of devices, workflow modifications or others. As a consequence, the accuracy of the anomaly detection process may be dramatically affected with a considerable amount of false alarms being generated. This article presents DAICS, a novel deep learning framework with a modular design to fit in large ICSs. The key component of the framework is a 2-branch neural network that learns the changes in the ICS behaviour with a small number of data samples and a few gradient updates. This is supported by an automatic tuning mechanism of the detection threshold that takes into account the changes in the prediction error under normal operating conditions. In this regard, no specialised human intervention is needed to update the other parameters of the system. DAICS has been evaluated using publicly available datasets and shows an increased detection rate and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, as well as higher robustness to additive noise.

AB Recently, reconstruction-based anomaly detection was proposed as an effective technique to detect attacks in dynamic industrial control networks. Unlike classical network anomaly detectors that observe the network traffic, reconstruction-based detectors operate on the measured sensor data, leveraging physical process models learned a priori.
   In this work, we investigate different approaches to evade prior-work reconstruction-based anomaly detectors by manipulating sensor data so that the attack is concealed. We find that replay attacks (commonly assumed to be very strong) show bad performance (i.e., increasing the number of alarms) if the attacker is constrained to manipulate less than 95% of all features in the system, as hidden correlations between the features are not replicated well. To address this, we propose two novel attacks that manipulate a subset of the sensor readings, leveraging learned physical constraints of the system. Our attacks feature two different attacker models: A white box attacker, which uses an optimization approach with a detection oracle, and a black box attacker, which uses an autoencoder to translate anomalous data into normal data. We evaluate our implementation on two different datasets from the water distribution domain, showing that the detector's Recall drops from 0.68 to 0.12 by manipulating 4 sensors out of 82 in WADI dataset. In addition, we show that our black box attacks are transferable to different detectors: They work against autoencoder-, LSTM-, and CNN-based detectors. Finally, we implement and demonstrate our attacks on a real industrial testbed to demonstrate their feasibility in real-time.

AB Industry 4.0 holds the promise of greater automation and productivity but also introduces new security risks to critical industrial control systems from unsecured devices and machines. Networks need to play a larger role in stopping attacks before they disrupt essential infrastructure as host-centric IT security solutions, such as anti-virus and software patching, have been ineffective in preventing IoT devices from getting compromised. We propose a network-centric, behavior-learning based, anomaly detection approach for securing such vulnerable environments. We demonstrate that the predictability of TCP traffic from IoT devices can be exploited to detect different types of DDoS attacks in real-time, using unsupervised machine learning (ML). From a small set of features, our ML classifier can separate normal and anomalous traffic. Our approach can be incorporated in a larger system for identifying compromised end-points despite IP spoofing, thus allowing the use of SDN-based mechanisms for blocking attack traffic close to the source. Compared to supervised ML methods, our unsupervised ML approaches are easier to instrument and are more effective in detecting new and unseen attacks.

AB Safe and reliable intelligent charging stations are imperative in an intelligent transportation infrastructure. Over the past few years, a big number of smart charging stations have been deployed, and most of them are online and connected, resulting in potential risks of threats. Although there exists related work on securing intelligent vehicles, very little work focused on the security of charging devices. Unlike traditional network systems, these power-related Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) use many different proprietary protocols and diverse interactions. Traditional anomaly detection methods based on network traffic are thus not suitable for these systems. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection method in real vehicle power supply systems based on a deep architecture model. In particular, we propose a novel traffic anomaly detection model based on Multi-Head Attentions (MHA) that take into account the inherent correlations of traffic generated by ICSs. The MHA model is employed to substitute the traditional feature extraction and rule making process with an acceptable computational cost for classifying traffic data. It is an attention-based model that employs Google Transformer encoder architecture to extract recessive features of traffic for anomaly detection. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated by experiments on two real-world power ICS testbeds including a substation with a slave charging station and a power generation simulation platform based on a distributed control system. Comprehensive experimental results indicate that the MHA model outperforms the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based and classical machine learning detection models with an accuracy rate of 99.86%.

AB Smart grids are a type of complex cyber-physical system (CPS) that integrates the communication capabilities of smart devices into the grid to facilitate remote operation and control of power systems. However, this integration exposes many existing vulnerabilities of conventional supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, resulting in severe cyber threats to the smart grid and potential violation of security objectives. Stealing sensitive information, modifying firmware, or injecting function codes through compromised devices are examples of possible attacks on the smart grid. Therefore, early detection of cyberattacks on the grid is crucial to protect it from sabotage. Machine learning (ML) methods are conventional approaches for detecting cyberattacks that use features of smart grid networks. However, developing an effective, highly accurate detection method with reduced computational overload, is still a challenging research problem. In this work, an efficient and effective security control approach is proposed to detect cyberattacks on the smart grid. The proposed approach combines both feature reduction and detection techniques to reduce the extremely large number of features and achieve an improved detection rate. A correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method is used to remove irrelevant features, improving detection efficiency. An instance-based learning (IBL) algorithm classifies normal and cyberattack events using the selected optimal features. This study describes a set of experiments conducted on public datasets from a SCADA power system based on a 10-fold cross-validation technique. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a high detection rate based on a small number of features drawn from SCADA power system measurements. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are widely used in critical infrastructures to support the essential services of society. Therefore, their protection against terrorist activities, natural disasters, and cyber threats is critical. Diverse cyber attack detection systems have been proposed over the years, in which each proposal has applied different steps and methods. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding methodologies to detect cyber attacks in ICS scenarios. The lack of such methodologies prevents researchers from being able to accurately compare proposals and results. In this work, we present a Methodology for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems (MADICS) to detect cyber attacks in ICS scenarios, which is intended to provide a guideline for future works in the field. MADICS is based on a semi-supervised anomaly detection paradigm and makes use of deep learning algorithms to model ICS behaviors. It consists of five main steps, focused on pre-processing the dataset to be used with the machine learning and deep learning algorithms; performing feature filtering to remove those features that do not meet the requirements; feature extraction processes to obtain higher order features; selecting, fine-tuning, and training the most appropriate model; and validating the model performance. In order to validate MADICS, we used the popular Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset, which was collected from a fully operational water treatment plant. The experiments demonstrate that, using MADICS, we can achieve a state-of-the-art precision of 0.984 (as well as a recall of 0.750 and F1-score of 0.851), which is above the average of other works, proving that the proposed methodology is suitable for use in real ICS scenarios.

AB Industrial control systems are critical to the operation of industrial facilities, especially for critical infrastructures, such as refineries, power grids, and transportation systems. Similar to other information systems, a significant threat to industrial control systems is the attack from cyberspace-the offensive maneuvers launched by "anonymous" in the digital world that target computer-based assets with the goal of compromising a system's functions or probing for information. Owing to the importance of industrial control systems, and the possibly devastating consequences of being attacked, significant endeavors have been attempted to secure industrial control systems from cyberattacks. Among them are intrusion detection systems that serve as the first line of defense by monitoring and reporting potentially malicious activities. Classical machine-learning-based intrusion detection methods usually generate prediction models by learning modest-sized training samples all at once. Such approach is not always applicable to industrial control systems, as industrial control systems must process continuous control commands with limited computational resources in a nonstop way. To satisfy such requirements, we propose using online learning to learn prediction models from the controlling data stream. We introduce several state-of-theart online learning algorithms categorically, and illustrate their efficacies on two typically used testbeds- power system and gas pipeline. Further, we explore a new cost-sensitive online learning algorithm to solve the class-imbalance problem that is pervasive in industrial intrusion detection systems. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an overall improvement in the detection rate of cyberattacks in industrial control systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Cyber physical system (CPS) is a network of cyber and physical elements, which interact with one another in a feedback form. CPS approves critical infrastructure and is treated as essential in day to day since it forms the basis of futuristic smart devices. An increased usage of CPSs poses security as a challenging issue and intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be applied for the identification of network intrusions. The latest advancements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) enables to design effective IDS models for the CPS environment. At the same time, metaheuristic algorithms can be employed as a feature selection approach in order to reduce the curse of dimensionality. With this motivation, this study develops a novel Poor and Rich Optimization with Deep Learning Model for Blockchain Enabled Intrusion Detection in CPS Environment, called PRO-DLBIDCPS technique. The proposed PRO-DLBIDCPS technique initially introduces an Adaptive Harmony Search Algorithm (AHSA) based feature selection technique for proper selection of feature subsets. For intrusion detection and classification, and attention based bi-directional gated recurrent neural network (ABi-GRNN) model is applied. In addition, the detection efficiency of the ABi-GRNN technique has been enhanced by the use of Poor and rich optimization (PRO) algorithm based hyperparameter optimizer, which resulted in enhanced intrusion detection results. Furthermore, blockchain technology is applied for enhancing security in the CPS environment. In order to demonstrate the enhanced outcomes of the PRO-DLBIDCPS technique, a wide range of simulations was carried out on benchmark dataset and the results reported the better outcomes of the PRO-DLBIDCPS technique in terms of several measures.

AB Cyber security risk management plays an important role for today's businesses due to the rapidly changing threat landscape and the existence of evolving sophisticated cyber attacks. It is necessary for organisations, of any size, but in particular those that are associated with a critical infrastructure, to understand the risks, so that suitable controls can be taken for the overall business continuity and critical service delivery. There are a number of works that aim to develop systematic processes for risk assessment and management. However, the existing works have limited input from threat intelligence properties and evolving attack trends, resulting in limited contextual information related to cyber security risks. This creates a challenge, especially in the context of critical infrastructures, since attacks have evolved from technical to socio-technical and protecting against them requires such contextual information. This research proposes a novel integrated cyber security risk management (i-CSRM) framework that responds to that challenge by supporting systematic identification of critical assets through the use of a decision support mechanism built on fuzzy set theory, by predicting risk types through machine learning techniques, and by assessing the effectiveness of existing controls. The framework is composed of a language, a process, and it is supported by an automated tool. The paper also reports on the evaluation of our work to a real case study of a critical infrastructure. The results reveal that using the fuzzy set theory in assessing assets' criticality, our work supports stakeholders towards an effective risk management by assessing each asset's criticality. Furthermore, the results have demonstrated the machine learning classifiers' exemplary performance to predict different risk types including denial of service, cyber espionage and crimeware.

AB Early and accurate anomaly detection in critical infrastructure (CI), such as water treatment plants and electric power grid, is necessary to avoid plant damage and service disruption. Several machine learning techniques have been employed for the design of an effective anomaly detector in such systems. However, threats such as from insiders and state actors, introduce challenges in the design of an effective anomaly detector. This work presents a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based anomaly detector that uses an unsupervised approach to safeguard CI from the adverse impacts of cyber-attacks. The proposed detector was trained using the data collected under the normal operation of the plant. The model captures the temporal dependencies between the samples and predicts the plant behavior. Further, the well-known CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) approach was used to detect the abnormal deviations between the observed and predicted sensor values for the identification and reporting of anomalies. Experimental validation of the proposed method was carried out using a dataset obtained from Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) an operational water treatment testbed under normal operation as well as under direct and stealthy attacks. The performance of MLP-CUSUM was compared against the state-of-the-art machine learning models in terms of its classification accuracy, precision, recall, Fl score, and the false alarm rate.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Among the many hacking attempts carried out against information systems for the past few years, cyber-attacks that could lead to a national-level threat included attacks against nuclear facilities particularly nuclear power stations. Two of the typical examples are the Stuxnet attack against an Iranian nuclear facility and the cyber threat against Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power in December 2015. The former has proven that a direct cyber-attack can actually stop the nuclear power station, and the latter has shown that people can be terrorized with only a (cyber) threat. After these incidents, security measures for cyber-attacks against industrial control systems have been strengthened. The nuclear power stations also changed their passive concept of executing security measures by operating the plant with an isolated network to prepare for the cyber-attacks carried out by malicious codes. The difference between the two concepts is that the latter has been formulated based on the possibility that most of the control systems can be targets of cyber-attacks. Threats against control systems are gradually increasing nowadays, so the relevant industries are implementing some measures to identify/develop safe and reliable digital equipment and identify risks to establish effective cyber security plans. Thus, this paper proposes a security measure based on the classification of past attack incidents against control systems and the big data analysis technique that processes the data generated from individual security equipment. The security of control systems is expected to be strengthened through such effective measure.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) advancements have revolutionized many critical domains by providing cost-effective, automated, and intelligent solutions. Recently, ChatGPT has achieved a momentous change and made substantial progress in natural language processing. As such, a chatbot-driven AI technology has the capabilities to interact and communicate with users and generate human-like responses. ChatGPT, on the other hand, has the potential to influence changes in the cybersecurity domain. ChatGPT can be utilized as a chatbot-driven security assistant for penetration testing to analyze, investigate, and develop security solutions. However, ChatGPT raises concerns about how the tool can be used for cybercrime and malicious activities. Attackers can use such a tool to cause substantial harm by exploiting vulnerabilities, writing malicious code, and circumventing security measures on a targeted system. This article investigates the implications of the ChatGPT model in the domain of cybersecurity. We present the state-of-the-art practical applications of ChatGPT in cybersecurity. In addition, we demonstrate in a case study how a ChatGPT can be used to design and develop False data injection attacks against critical infrastructure such as industrial control systems. Conversely, we show how such a tool can be used to help security analysts to analyze, design, and develop security solutions against cyberattacks. Finally, this article discusses the open challenges and future directions of ChatGPT in cybersecurity.

AB Black hat hackers use malicious exploits to circumvent security controls and take advantage of system vulnerabilities worldwide, costing the global economy over $450 billion annually. While many organizations are increasingly turning to cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to help prioritize their vulnerabilities, extant CTI processes are often criticized as being reactive to known exploits. One promising data source that can help develop proactive CTI is the vast and ever-evolving Dark Web. In this study, we adopted the computational design science paradigm to design a novel deep learning (DL)-based exploit-vulnerability attention deep structured semantic model (EVA-DSSM) that includes bidirectional processing and attention mechanisms to automatically link exploits from the Dark Web to vulnerabilities. We also devised a novel device vulnerability severity metric (DVSM) that incorporates the exploit post date and vulnerability severity to help cybersecurity professionals with their device prioritization and risk management efforts. We rigorously evaluated the EVA-DSSM against state-of-the-art non-DL and DL-based methods for short text matching on 52,590 exploit-vulnerability linkages across four testbeds: web application, remote, local, and denial of service. Results of these evaluations indicate that the proposed EVA-DSSM achieves precision at 1 scores 20% -41% higher than non-DL approaches and 4% -10% higher than DL-based approaches. We demonstrated the EVA-DSSM???s and DVSM???s practical utility with two CTI case studies: openly accessible systems in the top eight U.S. hospitals and over 20,000 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems worldwide. A complementary user evaluation of the case study results indicated that 45 cybersecurity professionals found the EVA-DSSM and DVSM results more useful for exploit-vulnerability linking and risk prioritization activities than those produced by prevailing approaches. Given the rising cost of cyberattacks, the EVA-DSSM and DVSM have important implications for analysts in security operations centers, incident response teams, and cybersecurity vendors.

AB The modernization of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), primarily targeting increased efficiency and controllability through integration of Information Technologies ( IT), introduced the unwanted side effect of extending the ICS cyber-security threat landscape. ICS are facing new security challenges and are exposed to the same vulnerabilities that plague IT, as demonstrated by the increasing number of incidents targeting ICS. Due to the criticality and unique nature of these systems, it is important to devise novel defense mechanisms that incorporate knowledge of the underlying physical model, and can detect attacks in early phases. To this end, we study a benchmark chemical process, and enumerate the various categories of attack vectors and their practical applicability on hardware controllers in a Hardware-In-The-Loop testbed. Leveraging the observed implications of the categorized attacks on the process, as well as the profile of typical disturbances, we follow a data-driven approach to detect anomalies that are early indicators of malicious activity.

AB With the development of computer and network technologies, the original security of industrial control systems (ICSs) has been compromised, and security issues have become increasingly prominent. Effective intrusion detection methods for ICSs have been proposed. Recently, intrusion detection methods based on deep learning, such as long short-term memory and gated recurrent units, have immensely improved the detection accuracy compared with traditional methods. However, there are still problems that remain to be solved, such as vanishing gradient and low training efficiency. Therefore, this study proposed an intrusion detection method based on a bidirectional simple recurrent unit (BiSRU). With skip connections employed, the optimized bidirectional structure in the SRU neural network is able to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and improve the training effectiveness. Two standard industrial datasets from Mississippi State University are used in the simulation. The results show that the proposed method is more accurate and requires less training time than other methods.

AB This study proposes an anomaly detection method for operational data of industrial control systems (ICSs). Sequence-to-sequence neural networks were applied to train and predict ICS operational data and interpret their time-series characteristic. The proposed method requires only a normal dataset to understand ICS's normal state and detect outliers. This method was evaluated with SWaT (secure water treatment) dataset, and 29 out of 36 attacks were detected. The reported method also detects the attack points, and 25 out of 53 points were detected. This study provides a detailed analysis of false positives and false negatives of the experimental results.

AB Optical networks are critical infrastructure supporting vital services and are vulnerable to different types of malicious attacks targeting service disruption at the optical layer. Due to the various attack techniques causing diverse physical-layer effects, as well as the limitations and sparse placement of optical performance monitoring devices, such attacks are difficult to detect, and their signatures are unknown. This paper presents an experimental investigation of a machine learning (ML) framework for detection and identification of physical-layer attacks, based on experimental attack traces from an operator field deployed testbed with coherent receivers. We perform in-band and out-of-band jamming signal insertion attacks, as well as polarization scrambling attacks, each with varying intensities. We then evaluate eight different ML classifiers in terms of their accuracy, and scalability in processing experimental data. The optical parameters critical for accurate attack identification are identified and the generalization of the models is validated. Results indicate that artificial neural networks achieve 99.9% accuracy in attack type and intensity classification, and are capable of processing 1 million samples in less than 10 seconds.

AB Wireless sensor and actuator networks are widely adopted in various applications such as critical infrastructure monitoring where sensory data in big volumes and velocity are prone to security vulnerabilities for the network and the monitored infrastructure. Despite the vulnerabilities of the big data phenomenon, intelligent data analytics technique can enable the analysis of huge amount of data and identification of intrusive behavior in real time. The main performance targets for any Intrusion Detection System (IDS) involve accuracy, detection, precision, F-1 score and Receiver Operating Characteristics. Pursuant to these, this paper proposes a big data-driven IDS approach in Wireless Sensor Networks by harnessing reinforcement learning techniques on a hybrid IDS framework. We study the performance of RL-IDS and compare it to the previously proposed Adaptive Machine Learning-based IDS (AML-IDS) namely the Adaptively Supervised and Clustered Hybrid IDS (ASCH-IDS). The experimental results show that RL-IDS can achieve approximate to 100% success in detection, accuracy and precision- recall rates whereas its predecessor ASCH-IDS performs with an accuracy level that is slightly above 99%.

AB In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of smart grid security against cyber-physical attacks on its distinct functional components. We discuss: (1) a function-based methodology to evaluate smart grid resilience against cyber-physical attacks; (2) a Bayesian Attack Graph for Smart Grid (BAGS) tool to compute the likelihood of the compromise of cyber components of the smart grid system; (3) risk analysis methodology, which combines the results of the function-based methodology and BAGS to quantify risk for each cyber component of the smart grid; and (4) efficient resource allocation in the smart grid cyber domain using reinforcement learning (extension of BAGS tool) to compute optimal policies about whether to perform vulnerability assessment or patch a cyber system of the smart grid whose vulnerability has already been discovered. The results and analysis of these approaches help power engineers to identify failures in advance from one system component to another, develop robust and more resilient power systems and improve situational awareness and the response of the system to cyber-physical attacks. This work sheds light on the interdependency between the cyber domain and power grid and demonstrates that the security of both worlds requires the utmost attention. We hope this work assists power engineers to protect the grid against future cyber-physical attacks.

AB Deploying machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) is an effective way to improve the security of industrial control systems (ICS). However, ML models themselves are vulnerable to adversarial examples, generated by deliberately adding subtle perturbation to the input sample that some people are not aware of, causing the model to give a false output with high confidence. In this article, our goal is to investigate the possibility of stealthy cyber attacks towards IDS, including injection attack, function code attack and reconnaissance attack, and enhance its robustness to adversarial attack. However, adversarial algorithms are subject to communication protocol and legal range of data in ICS, unlike only limited by the distance between original samples and newly generated samples in image domain. We propose two strategies - optimal solution attack and GAN attack - oriented to flexibility and volume of data, formulating an optimization problem to find stealthy attacks, where the former is appropriate for not too large and more flexible samples while the latter provides a more efficient solution for larger and not too flexible samples. Finally, we conduct experiments on a semi-physical ICS testbed with a high detection performance ensemble ML-based detector to show the effectiveness of our attacks. The results indicate that new samples of reconnaissance and function code attack produced by both optimal solution and GAN algorithm possess 80 percent higher probability to evade the detector, still maintaining the same attack effect. In the meantime, we adopt adversarial training as a method to defend against adversarial attack. After training on the mixture of orginal dataset and newly generated samples, the detector becomes more robust to adversarial examples.

AB With the rapid advancement in the industrial control technologies and the increased deployment of the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) in the buildings sector, this work presents an analysis of the security of the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system which is a major component of the Building Management System (BMS), has become critical. This paper presents a Transient System Simulation Tool (TRNSYS) model of a 12-zone HVAC system that allows assessing the cybersecurity aspect of HVAC systems. The thermal comfort model and the estimated total power usage are used to assess the magnitude of the malicious actions launched against the HVAC system. Simulation data are collected and used to develop and validate a semi-supervised, data-driven attack detection strategy using Isolation Forest (IF) for the system under study. Three schemes of the proposed approach are investigated, which are: using raw data, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction, and using 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based encoder for temporal feature extraction. The proposed approach is compared with standard machine-learning approaches, and it demonstrates a promising capability in attack detection for a range of attack scenarios with high reliability and low computational cost.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) devices are extensively used in modern industries combined with the conventional industrial control system (ICS) network through the industrial cloud to make the production data easily available to the corporate business management and easier control for highly profitable production systems. The different devices within the conventional ICS network originally manufactured to run on an isolated network and was not considered for the privacy and security of the control and production/architecture data being trafficked over the manufacturing plant to the corporate. Due to their extensive integration with the industrial cloud network over the internet, these ICS networks are exposed to a significant threat of malicious activities created by malicious software. Protecting ICS from such attacks requires continuous update of their database of anti-malware tools which requires efforts from manual experts on a regular basis. This limits real time protection of ICS.
   Earlier work by Huda et al. (2017) based on a semi-supervised approach performed well. However training process of the semi-supervised-approach (Huda et al., 2017) is complex procedure which requires a hybridization of feature selection, unsupervised clustering and supervised training techniques. Therefore, it could be time consuming for ICS network for real time protection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive threat detection model for industrial cloud of things (CoT) based on deep learning. Deep learning has been used in many domain of pattern recognition and a popular approach for its simple training procedure. Most importantly, deep learning can learn the hidden patterns of the domain in an unsupervised manner which can avoid the requirements of huge expensive labeled data. We used this particular characteristic of deep learning to design our detection model.
   Two different types of deep learning based detection models are proposed in this work. The first model uses a disjoint training and testing data for a deep belief network (DBN) and corresponding artificial neural network (ANN). In the second proposed detection model, DBN is trained using new unlabeled data to provide DBN with additional knowledge about the changes in the malicious attack patterns. Novelty of the proposed detection models is that the models are adaptive where training procedures is simpler than earlier work (Huda et al, 2017) and can adapt new malware behaviors from already available and cheap unlabeled data at the same time. This will avoid expensive manual labeling of new attacks and corresponding time complexity making it feasible for ICS networks. Performances of standard DBNs are sensitive to its configurations and values for the hyper-parameters including number of hidden nodes, learning rate and number epochs. Therefore proposed detection models find an optimal configuration by varying the structure of DBNs and other parameters. The proposed detection models are extensively tested on a real malware test bed. Experimental results show that the proposed approaches achieve higher accuracies than standard detection algorithms and obtain similar performances with earlier semi supervised work (Huda et al., 2017) but provide a comparatively simplified training model.

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems complexity and interconnectivity increase in recent years have exposed the SCADA networks to numerous potential vulnerabilities. Several studies have shown that anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) achieves improved performance to identify unknown or zero-day attacks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks using machine learning approach. In the first part, we present a robust hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks. Finally, we present a feature selection model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks by removing redundant and irrelevant features. Irrelevant features in the dataset can affect modeling power and reduce predictive accuracy. These models were evaluated using an industrial control system dataset developed at the Distributed Analytics and Security Institute Mississippi State University Starkville, MS, USA. The experimental results show that our proposed model has a key effect in reducing the time and computational complexity and achieved improved accuracy and detection rate. The accuracy of our proposed model was measured as 99.5 % for specific-attack-labeled.

AB The surging usage of electric vehicles (EVs) demand the robust deployment of trustworthy electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) with millisecond range latency and massive machine to machine communications where 5G could act. However, 5G suffers from inherent protocols, hardware, and software vulnerabilities that seriously threaten the communicating entities' cyber-physical security. To overcome these limitations in the EVCS system, this paper analyses the impact of False Data Injection (FDI) and Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks on the operation of EVCS. This work is an extension of the previously published conference paper about the EVCS. As new features, this paper simulates the FDI attack and the syn flood DDoS attacks on 5G enabled remote Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that controls the solar photovoltaics (PV) controller, Battery Energy Storage (BES) controller, and EV controller of the EVCS. The extent of delay has been increased to more than 500 ms with the severe DDoS attack via 5G. The attacks make the EVCS system oscillate or shift the DC operating point. The frequency of oscillation, its damping, and the system's resiliency are found to be related to the attacks' intensity and the target controller. Finally, the novel stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are proposed solely based on the electrical fingerprint. This model can detect the stealthy cyberattacks that bypass the cyber layer and go unnoticed in the monitoring system with nearly 100% detection accuracy.

AB The backbone of the economy, security and sustainability of a state is inseparably linked to the security of its critical infrastructure. Critical infrastructures define goods, systems or subsystems that are essential to maintain the vital functions of society, health, physical protection, security plus economic and social well-being of citizens. The digital security of critical infrastructures is a very important priority for the well-being of every country, especially nowadays, because of the direct threats dictated by the current international conjuncture and due to the emerging interactions or interconnections developed between the National Critical Infrastructures, internationally. The aim of this research is the development and testing of an Anomaly Detection intelligent algorithm that has the advantage to run very fast with a small portion of the available data and to perform equally well with the existing approaches. Such a system must be characterized by high efficiency and very fast execution. Thus, we present the Gryphon advanced intelligence system. Gryphon is a Semi-Supervised Unary Anomaly Detection System for big industrial data which is employing an evolving Spiking Neural Network (eSNN) One-Class Classifier (eSNN-OCC). This machine learning algorithm corresponds to a model capable of detecting very fast and efficiently, divergent behaviors and abnormalities associated with cyberattacks, which are known as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). The training process is performed on data related to the normal function of a critical infrastructure.

AB Data-centric approaches are becoming increasingly common in the creation of defense mechanisms for critical infrastructure such as the electric power grid and water treatment plants. Such approaches often use well-known methods from machine learning and system identification, i.e., the Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, and Deep Auto Encoders to create process anomaly detectors. Such detectors are then evaluated using data generated from an operational plant or a simulator; rarely is the assessment conducted in real time on a live plant. Regardless of the method to create an anomaly detector, and the data used for performance evaluation, there remain significant challenges that ought to be overcome before such detectors can be deployed with confidence in city-scale plants or large electric power grids. This position paper enumerates such challenges that the authors have faced when creating data-centric anomaly detectors and using them in a live plant.

AB Modern industrial systems and critical infrastructures are constantly exposed to malicious cyber-attacks that are challenging and difficult to identify. Cyber-attacks can cause severe economic losses and damage the attacked system if not detected accurately and timely. Therefore, designing an accurate and sensitive intrusion detection system is undoubtedly necessary to ensure the productivity and safety of industrial systems against cyber-attacks. This paper first introduces a stacked deep learning method to detect malicious attacks in SCADA systems. We also consider eleven machine learning models, including the Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random forest, Bagging, support vector machines with different kernels, classification tree pruned by the minimum cross-validation and by 1-standard error rule, linear discriminate analysis, conditional inference tree, and the C5.0 tree. Real data sets with different kinds of cyber-attacks from two laboratory-scale SCADA systems, gas pipeline and water storage tank systems, are employed to evaluate the performance of the investigated methods. Seven evaluation metrics have been used to compare the investigated models (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under curve, or AUC). Overall, results show that the XGBoost approach achieved superior detection performance than all other investigated methods. This could be due to its desirable characteristics to avoid overfitting, decreases the complexity of individual trees, robustness to outliers, and invariance to scaling and monotonic transformations of the features. Unexpectedly, the deep learning models are not providing the best performance in this case study, even with their extended capacity to capture complex features interactions.

AB The advent of the Smart Grid (SG) raises severe cybersecurity risks that can lead to devastating consequences. In this paper, we present a novel anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS), called ARIES (smArt gRid Intrusion dEtection System), which is capable of protecting efficiently SG communications. ARIES combines three detection layers that are devoted to recognising possible cyberattacks and anomalies against (a) network flows, (b) Modbus/Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packets and (c) operational data. Each detection layer relies on a Machine Learning (ML) model trained using data originating from a power plant. In particular, the first layer (network flow-based detection) performs a supervised multiclass classification, recognising Denial of Service (DoS), brute force attacks, port scanning attacks and bots. The second layer (packet-based detection) detects possible anomalies related to the Modbus packets, while the third layer (operational data based detection) monitors and identifies anomalies upon operational data (i.e., time series electricity measurements). By emphasising on the third layer, the ARIES Generative Adversarial Network (ARIES GAN) with novel error minimisation functions was developed, considering mainly the reconstruction difference. Moreover, a novel reformed conditional input was suggested, consisting of random noise and the signal features at any given time instance. Based on the evaluation analysis, the proposed GAN network overcomes the efficacy of conventional ML methods in terms of Accuracy and the F1 score.

AB Anomaly detection is critical to the efficient and secure operation of industrial equipment, integrated sensors, and the overall production process. Cyber-physical systems and supervisory control and data acquisition systems often embed algorithms for anomaly detection. Anomalies are, by definition, rare events and labor-intensive to identify. Pipelined deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNN), 1-D convolution neural networks (1DCNN), and generative adversarial networks create unique anomaly detection architectures. These architectures are unsupervised, and labeled anomaly data is not required. With two large, multivariate time-series testbed experimental datasets, comparisons are made between the neural network architectures and traditional machine learning (TML) baseline techniques. Evaluation metrics appropriate for imbalanced anomaly datasets include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the precision-recall tradeoff curve. Experimental results demonstrate that pipelined neural network architectures exhibit higher detection rates than the TML techniques. 1DCNN can substitute for RNNs when performance and long time-sequences are essential.

AB The proliferation of various connected platforms, including Internet of things, industrial control systems (ICSs), connected cars, and in-vehicle networks, has resulted in the simultaneous use of multiple protocols and devices. Chaotic situations caused by the usage of different protocols and various types of devices, such as heterogeneous networks, implemented differently by vendors renders the adoption of a flexible security solution difficult, such as recent deep learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) studies. These studies optimized the deep learning model for their environment to improve performance, but the basic principle of the deep learning model used was not changed, so this can be called a next-generation IDS with a model that has little or no requirements. Some studies proposed IDS based on unsupervised learning technology that does not require labeled data. However, not using available assets, such as network packet data, is a waste of resources. If the security solution considers the role and importance of the devices constituting the network and the security area of the protocol standard by experts, the assets can be well used, but it will no longer be flexible. Most deep learning model-based IDS studies used recurrent neural network (RNN), which is a supervised learning model, because the characteristics of the RNN model, especially when the long-short term memory (LSTM) is incorporated, are better configured to reflect the flow of the packet data stream over time, and thus perform better than other supervised learning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN). However, if the input data induce the CNN's kernel to sufficiently reflect the network characteristics through proper preprocessing, it could perform better than other deep learning models in the network IDS. Hence, we propose the first preprocessing method, called "direct", for network IDS that can use the characteristics of the kernel by using the minimum protocol information, field size, and offset. In addition to direct, we propose two more preprocessing techniques called "weighted" and "compressed". Each requires additional network information; therefore, direct conversion was compared with related studies. Including direct, the proposed preprocessing methods are based on field-to-pixel philosophy, which can reflect the advantages of CNN by extracting the convolutional features of each pixel. Direct is the most intuitive method of applying field-to-pixel conversion to reflect an image's convolutional characteristics in the CNN. Weighted and compressed are conversion methods used to evaluate the direct method. Consequently, the IDS constructed using a CNN with the proposed direct preprocessing method demonstrated meaningful performance in the NSL-KDD dataset.

AB The intrusion detection method of power industrial control systems is a crucial aspect of assuring power security. However, traditional intrusion detection methods have two drawbacks: first, they are mainly used for defending information systems and lack the ability to detect attacks against power industrial control systems; and second, although machine learning-based intrusion detection methods perform well with the default hyperparameters, optimizing the hyperparameters can significantly improve its performance. In response to these limitations, a random forest (RF)-based intrusion detection model for power industrial control systems is proposed. Simultaneously, this paper proposes an improved grid search algorithm (IGSA) for optimizing the hyperparameters of the RF intrusion detection model to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed IGSA boosts the speed of calculation from O(n(m)) to O(n x m). The suggested model is evaluated based on the public power industrial control system dataset after hyperparameter optimization. The experiment results show that our method achieves a superior detection performance with the accuracy of 98% and has more outstanding performance than the same type of work.

AB The technological leap of smart technologies has brought the conventional electrical grid in a new digital era called Smart Grid (SG), providing multiple benefits, such as two-way communication, pervasive control and self-healing. However, this new reality generates significant cybersecurity risks due to the heterogeneous and insecure nature of SG. In particular, SG relies on legacy communication protocols that have not been implemented having cybersecurity in mind. Moreover, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) creates severe cybersecurity challenges. The Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems constitute an emerging technology in the cybersecurity area, having the capability to detect, normalise and correlate a vast amount of security events. They can orchestrate the entire security of a smart ecosystem, such as SG. Nevertheless, the current SIEM systems do not take into account the unique SG peculiarities and characteristics like the legacy communication protocols. In this paper, we present the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) SIEM, which focuses on SG. The main contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a SIEM system capable of detecting, normalising and correlating cyberattacks and anomalies against a plethora of SG application-layer protocols. It is noteworthy that the detection performance of the SPEAR SIEM is demonstrated with real data originating from four real SG use case (a) hydropower plant, (b) substation, (c) power plant and (d) smart home.

AB The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play an important role in monitoring industrial processes such as electric power distribution, transport systems, water distribution, and wastewater collection systems. Such systems require a particular attention with regards to security aspects, as they deal with critical infrastructures that are crucial to organizations and countries. Protecting SCADA systems from intrusion is a very challenging task because they do not only inherit traditional IT security threats but they also include additional vulnerabilities related to field components (e.g., cyber-physical attacks). Many of the existing intrusion detection techniques rely on supervised learning that consists of algorithms that are first trained with reference inputs to learn specific information, and then tested on unseen inputs for classification purposes. This article surveys supervised learning from a specific security angle, namely SCADA-based intrusion detection. Based on a systematic review process, existing literature is categorized and evaluated according to SCADA-specific requirements. Additionally, this survey reports on well-known SCADA datasets and testbeds used with machine learning methods. Finally, we present key challenges and our recommendations for using specific supervised methods for SCADA systems.

AB The growing volume of data, especially in cases of imbalanced datasets, has posed significant challenges in the classification process, particularly when it comes to identifying cyberattacks on industrial control systems (ICS) networks, which have been a source of concern due to the significant destructive impact of viruses such as Slammer, worms, Stuxnet, Duqu, Seismic Net, and Flame on critical infrastructures in various countries. The key challenge is constructing the intrusion detection system (IDS) framework to deal with imbalanced datasets. Many researchers work especially on binary classification, but multi-classification is a more challenging and still active research area. To deal with the multi-class imbalanced classification problem, we outline an instance-based intrusion detection technique named ICS-IDS, for intrusion detection in ICS systems specific to SCADA networks. The developed technique consists of two core components, the data preparation component, and the detection component. The data preparation component uses the normalization, Fisher Discriminant Analysis, and k-neighbor's method to scale the data, reduce the dimensionality, and resample the dataset, respectively. To learn the latent representations and discern harmful vectors from attacked data, the detection/recognition component leverages an efficient instance-based learner. The proposed ICS-IDS model outperforms existing attractive methods in detecting sophisticated attack vectors in ICS data, achieving 99% accuracy and 99% detection rates (DR) on an industrial network dataset. This proves the methodology's practicality for implementing security in real-world ICS networks.

AB The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) has transformed factories into smart Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs), where man, product, and machine are fully interconnected across the whole supply chain. Although this digitalization brings enormous advantages through customized, transparent, and agile manufacturing, it introduces a significant number of new attack vectors-e.g., through vulnerable Internet-of-Things (IoT) nodes-that can be leveraged by attackers to launch sophisticated Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks threatening the availability of the production line, business services, or even the human lives. In this article, we adopt a Machine Learning (ML) approach for network anomaly detection and construct different data-driven models to detect DDoS attacks on Industry 4.0 CPPSs. Existing techniques use data either artificially synthesized or collected from Information Technology (IT) networks or small-scale lab testbeds. To address this limitation, we use network traffic data captured from a real-world semiconductor production factory. We extract 45 bidirectional network flow features and construct several labeled datasets for training and testing ML models. We investigate 11 different supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised algorithms and assess their performance through extensive simulations. The results show that, in terms of the detection performance, supervised algorithms outperform both unsupervised and semi-supervised ones. In particular, the Decision Tree model attains an Accuracy of 0.999 while confining the False Positive Rate to 0.001.

AB Presently, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are broadly adopted in remote monitoring large-scale production systems and modern power grids. However, SCADA systems are continuously exposed to various heterogeneous cyberattacks, making the detection task using the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) very challenging. Furthermore, conventional security solutions, such as firewalls, and antivirus software, are not appropriate for fully protecting SCADA systems because they have distinct specifications. Thus, accurately detecting cyber-attacks in critical SCADA systems is undoubtedly indispensable to enhance their resilience, ensure safe operations, and avoid costly maintenance. The overarching goal of this paper is to detect malicious intrusions that already detoured traditional IDS and firewalls. In this paper, a stacked deep learning method is introduced to identify malicious attacks targeting SCADA systems. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of a deep learning approach for intrusion detection in SCADA systems. Real data sets from two laboratory-scale SCADA systems, a two-line three-bus power transmission system and a gas pipeline are used to evaluate the proposed method's performance. The results of this investigation show the satisfying detection performance of the proposed stacked deep learning approach. This study also showed that the proposed approach outperformed the standalone deep learning models and the state-of-the-art algorithms, including Nearest neighbor, Random forests, Naive Bayes, Adaboost, Support Vector Machine, and oneR. Besides detecting the malicious attacks, we also investigate the feature importance of the cyber-attacks detection process using the Random Forest procedure, which helps design more parsimonious models.

AB Gradual increase in the number of successful attacks against Industrial Control Systems (ICS) has led to an urgent need to create defense mechanisms for accurate and timely detection of the resulting process anomalies. Towards this end, a class of anomaly detectors, created using data-centric approaches, are gaining attention. Using machine learning algorithms such approaches can automatically learn the process dynamics and control strategies deployed in an ICS. The use of these approaches leads to relatively easier and faster creation of anomaly detectors compared to the use of design-centric approaches that are based on plant physics and design. Despite the advantages, there exist significant challenges and implementation issues in the creation and deployment of detectors generated using machine learning for city-scale plants. In this work, we enumerate and discuss such challenges. Also presented is a series of lessons learned in our attempt to meet these challenges in an operational plant.

AB Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are evolving into smart environments with increased interconnectivity by being connected to the Internet. These changes increase the likelihood of security vulnerabilities and accidents. As the risk of cyberattacks on ICS has increased, various anomaly detection studies are being conducted to detect abnormal situations in industrial processes. However, anomaly detection in ICS suffers from numerous false alarms. When false alarms occur, multiple sensors need to be checked, which is impractical. In this study, when an anomaly is detected, sensors displaying abnormal behavior are visually presented through XAI-based analysis to support quick practical actions and operations. Anomaly Detection has designed and applied better anomaly detection technology than the first prize at HAICon2020, an ICS security threat detection AI contest hosted by the National Security Research Institute last year, and explains the anomalies detected in its model. To the best of our knowledge, our work is at the forefront of explainable anomaly detection research in ICS. Therefore, it is expected to increase the utilization of anomaly detection technology in ICS.

AB Security of critical infrastructures is very important and remote healthcare systems are of those critical infrastructures which need more attention regarding security issues. Remote healthcare systems collect data of patients continuously and react appropriately. Although personal medical data needs to be protected, security issues are ignored in most of the remote healthcare systems. Therefore, in this paper, our research goal is to propose an architecture that performs secure remote healthcare system. We aim to offer a secure framework for remote healthcare systems that preserve the data of the system as safe as possible against common network attacks including Denial of Service (DoS) and User to Root (U2R) attacks. To do so, we designed an intrusion detection system (IDS) using one of the machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM). After implementing our method, the evaluation parameters of the layered architecture of IDS prove the efficiency of our proposed framework.

AB Integrating IoT devices in SCADA systems has provided efficient and improved data collection and transmission technologies. This enhancement comes with significant security challenges, exposing traditionally isolated systems to the public internet. Effective and highly reliable security devices, such as intrusion detection system (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), are critical. Countless studies used deep learning algorithms to design an efficient IDS; however, the fundamental issue of imbalanced datasets was not fully addressed. In our research, we examined the impact of data imbalance on developing an effective SCADA-based IDS. To investigate the impact of various data balancing techniques, we chose two unbalanced datasets, the Morris power dataset, and CICIDS2017 dataset, including random sampling, one-sided selection (OSS), near-miss, SMOTE, and ADASYN. For binary classification, convolutional neural networks were coupled with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM). The system's effectiveness was determined by the confusion matrix, which includes evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, detection rate, and F1-score. Four experiments on the two datasets demonstrate the impact of the data imbalance. This research aims to help security researchers in understanding imbalanced datasets and their impact on DL SCADA-IDS.

AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is an emerging technology with prompt evolution in diverse applications, including critical infrastructure. While the increasing number of IIoT devices in today's critical infrastructure enhances their efficiency and reliability, it also increases their vulnerability towards cyber-attacks. Ambient Intelligence (AmI), including machine learning techniques, is a way to handle such challenges with minimizing the human role. Although using machine learning-based techniques is increased in some applications these days, they are not widely used in IIoT environments due to the privacy issues of transferring all the data into a single machine to train the models. This paper proposes an ensemble-based deep federated learning cyber-threat hunting model to hunt the attack samples without data sharing. The proposed hunting model consists of two parallel federated-based components, one analyzes the IIoT status based on the normal situation of the network, and the other analyzes it with considering the threat situation. This model used an ensemble of classifiers to make the final decision. The proposed cyber-threat hunting model is evaluated using two test cases and compared with some works in the literature and outperformed them in the f1-score metric. Moreover, evaluations show that the proposed model acts stable in facing different numbers of clients, and its training time is faster than the centralized models with the same computational complexity.

AB The ongoing digitalization enables stable control processes and smooth operations of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). A direct consequence of the highly interconnected architecture of ICSs is the introduced cyber vulnerability and increasing cyber security threats to ICSs. Numerous researches pay attention to the security problem of ICSs. However, most current studies face two challenges. First, the interaction problem between the cyber layer and the physical layer of ICSs may result in incorrect attack response strategies. Second, ICSs are real-time systems, but existing defense decision algorithms based on game theory or reinforcement learning techniques have high computational complexity, which prevents them from making decisions quickly. In this paper, we design a new multi-attribute based method for quantifying rewards and propose a multi-attribute based Q-learning algorithm to resolve the interaction problem. In addition, to overcome the limitation of slow convergence, we develop an effective parallel Q-learning (PQL) algorithm to quickly find the optimal strategy. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the PQL algorithm. Compared with the Q-learning algorithm (QL) and the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm, our proposed solution can reduce the average completion time by 12.5 to 37 percent.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for remote control and monitoring. Sophisticated security measures are needed to address malicious intrusions, which are steadily increasing in number and variety due to the massive spread of connectivity and standardisation of open SCADA protocols. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) cannot detect attacks that are not already present in their databases. Therefore, in this paper, we assess Machine Learning (ML) for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using a real data set collected from a gas pipeline system and provided by the Mississippi State University (MSU). The contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) The evaluation of four techniques for missing data estimation and two techniques for data normalization, 2) The performances of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) are assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 score for intrusion detection. Two cases are differentiated: binary and categorical classifications. Our experiments reveal that RF detect intrusions effectively, with an F-1 score of respectively > 99%.

AB Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America.

AB Industrial control systems (ICSs) are facing serious and evolving security threats because of a variety of malicious attacks. Deep learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been widely considered as one of promising security solutions for ICSs, but these deep neural networks for IDSs in ICSs have been designed manually, which are extremely dependent on expert experience with numerous model parameters. This paper makes the first attempt to develop an automatic architecture design method of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on differential evolution (abbreviated as DE-CNN) for the intrusion detection issue in ICSs. The first phase of the proposed DE-CNN is the off-line architecture optimization of the CNNs constructed by three basic units such as ResNetBlockUnit, DenseNetBlockUnit, and PoolingUnit, including encoding the architecture parameters of a CNN as a population, evaluating the fitness of the population by the validation accuracy and the number of CNN model parameters, implementing the evolutionary process including mutation and crossover operations, and selecting the best individual from the population. Then, the optimal CNN model obtained by the off-line optimization of DE-CNN is deployed for the online IDSs. The experimental results on two intrusion detection datasets in ICSs including SWaT and WADI have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed DE-CNN to the state-of-the-art manually-designed and neuroevolution-based methods under both unsupervised and supervised learning in terms of Precision, Recall , F 1 -Score and the number of the CNN model parameters.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Heterogeneous cyberattacks against industrial control systems (ICSs) have had a strong impact on the physical world in recent decades. Connecting devices to the internet enables new attack surfaces for attackers. The intrusion of ICSs, such as the manipulation of industrial sensory or actuator data, can be the cause for anomalous ICS behaviors. This poses a threat to the infrastructure that is critical for the operation of a modern city. Nowadays, the best techniques for detecting anomalies in ICSs are based on machine learning and, more recently, deep learning. Cybersecurity in ICSs is still an emerging field, and industrial datasets that can be used to develop anomaly detection techniques are rare. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning methodology for anomaly detection in ICSs, specifically, a lightweight long short-term memory variational auto-encoder (LW-LSTM-VAE) architecture. We successfully demonstrate our solution under two ICS applications, namely, water purification and water distribution plants. Our proposed method proves to be efficient in detecting anomalies in these applications and improves upon reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods presented in previous work. For example, we successfully detected 82.16% of the anomalies in the scenario of the widely used Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) benchmark. The deep learning architecture we propose has the added advantage of being extremely lightweight.

AB The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification has been widely used for defective product identification and anomaly detection in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In this article, we propose a secure and efficient distributed kNN classification algorithm (SEED-kNN) to prevent information and control flow exposure while supporting large-scale data classification on distributed servers. Specifically, we first design a secure and efficient vector homomorphic encryption (VHE) scheme by constructing a key-switching matrix and a noise matrix for data encryption. Based on the designed VHE, SEED-kNN is proposed to efficiently achieve the confidentiality of data flow, kNN query, and class label, while enabling homomorphic operations on the encrypted data. Moreover, by leveraging the Map/Reduce architecture, SEED-kNN enables the kNN classification over the large-scale encrypted data on distributed servers for industrial control systems. Finally, we demonstrate that SEED-kNN achieves semantic security and high classification accuracy, and is applicable in IIoT due to its high efficiency.

AB We present an innovative approach for a Cybersecurity Solution based on the Intrusion Detection System to detect malicious activity targeting the Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) layers in the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. As Information and Communication Technology is connected to the grid, it is subjected to both physical and cyber-attacks because of the interaction between industrial control systems and the outside Internet environment using IoT technology. Often, cyber-attacks lead to multiple risks that affect infrastructure and business continuity; furthermore, in some cases, human beings are also affected. Because of the traditional peculiarities of process systems, such as insecure real-time protocols, end-to-end general-purpose ICT security mechanisms are not able to fully secure communication in SCADA systems. In this paper, we present a novel method based on the DNP3 vulnerability assessment and attack model in different layers, with feature selection using Machine Learning from parsed DNP3 protocol with additional data including malware samples. Moreover, we developed a cyber-attack algorithm that included a classification and visualization process. Finally, the results of the experimental implementation show that our proposed Cybersecurity Solution based on IDS was able to detect attacks in real time in an IoT-based Smart Grid communication environment.

AB The cyber-physical system (CPS) plays a crucial role in supporting critical infrastructure like water treatment facilities, gas stations, air conditioning components, and smart grids, which are essential to society. However, these systems are facing a growing susceptibility to a wide range of emerging attacks. Cyber-attacks against CPS have the potential to cause disruptions in the accurate sensing and actuation processes, resulting in significant harm to physical entities and posing concerns for the overall safety of society. Unlike common security measures like firewalls and encryption, which often aren ' t enough to deal with the unique problems that CPS architectures present, deploying machine learning -based intrusion detection systems (IDS) that are specifically made for CPS has become an important way to make them safer. The application of machine learning algorithms has been suggested as a means of mitigating cyber-attacks on CPS. However, the limited availability of labelled data pertaining to emerging attack techniques poses a significant challenge to the accurate detection of such attacks. In the given scenario, transfer learning emerges as a promising methodology for the detection of cyber-attacks, as it involves the implicit modelling of the system. In this research, we propose a new lightweight transfer learning method via ResNet50-CNN1D for intrusion detection in CPS. The Adaptive Gradient (Adagrad) optimizer was applied in the proposed model to minimize the loss function through the adjustment of network weight. We tested how well the suggested ResNet50-1D-CNN model worked using the UNSW-NB15 dataset and a control system dataset called HAI. The HAI dataset was taken from the testbed and based on a planned physical attack scenario. By calculating the coefficient scores for the top ten (10) features in the HAI and UNSW-NB15 data, it was possible to determine the relevance of a feature. The rationale behind employing transfer learning was to mitigate the complexity associated with the classification of cyber-attacks and runtime. The utilization of transfer learning resulted in notable reductions in both the training and testing times required for the detection of attacks. On the HAI data, the results showed an accuracy of 97.32 %, recall of 98.41 %, F1 -score of 96.32 %, and precision of 97.09 %. On the UNSW-NB15 data, the results showed an accuracy of 99.89 %, recall of 99.09 %, F1score of 98.01 %, and precision of 98.70 %.

AB With increasing adoption of advanced meter infrastructure, smart sensors together with SCADA systems, it is imperative to develop novel data analytics and couple the results with hydraulic modeling to improve the quality and efficiency of water services. One important task is to timely detect and localize anomaly events, which may include, but not be limited to, pipe bursts and unauthorized water usages. In this paper, a comprehensive solution framework has been developed for anomaly detection and localization by formulating and integrating data-driven analytics with hydraulic model calibration. Data analysis for anomaly detection proceeds in multiple steps including the following: (1) data pre-processing to eliminate and correct erroneous data records, (2) outlier detection by statistical process control methods and deep machine learning, and (3) system anomaly classification by correlation analysis of multiple sensor events. Classified system anomaly events are subsequently localized via hydraulic model calibration. The integrated solution framework is developed as a user-friendly and effective software tool, tested, and validated on the selected target areas in Singapore.

AB The next-generation of Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems pose numerous challenges in terms of cybersecurity monitoring. We have been witnessing the convergence of OT/IT networks, combined with massively distributed metering and control scenarios such as smart grids. Larger and geographically widespread attack surfaces, and inherently more data to analyse, will become the norm.
   Despite several advances in recent years, domain-specific security tools have been facing the challenges of trying to catch up with all the existing security flaws from the past, while also accounting for the specific needs of the next-generation of IACS. Moreover, the aggregation of multiple techniques and sources of information into a comprehensive approach has not been explored in depth. Such a holistic perspective is paramount since it enables a global and enhanced analysis enabled by the usage, combination and aggregation of the outputs from multiple sources and techniques.
   This paper starts by providing a review of the more recent anomaly detection techniques for SCADA systems, focused on both theoretical machine learning approaches and complete frameworks. Afterwards, it proposes a complete framework for an Intrusion and Anomaly Detection System (IADS) composed of specific detection probes, an event processing layer and a core anomaly detection component, amongst others. Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of the framework within a large-scale hybrid testbed, and a comparison of different anomaly detection scenarios based on various machine learning techniques.

AB As the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) continues to expand, the need for effective device identification becomes critical for securing industrial environments. Network traffic fingerprinting has emerged as an important technique for IIoT device identification, leveraging the unique communication patterns embedded in network traffic. Despite significant efforts in this area, a comprehensive overview of the relevant research is still missing. To address the lack of comprehensive research, this paper, for the first time, identifies critical knowledge gaps constraining IIoT device identification through network traffic analysis: obscure fingerprint feature space, limited generalizability to unknowns, and scarce data sources. Focusing on these gaps, existing methods are analyzed and summarized in detail across network traffic fingerprinting, IIoT device identification, and public IIoT datasets. Specifically, network traffic fingerprinting methods are categorized into three levels: Packet-level, flow-level, and business-level, and relevant methods are examined in terms of data formats, segmentation units, and extraction or generation techniques. In the context of IIoT device identification, tasks such as device type, model, and instance recognition, as well as abnormal device detection, are extensively investigated using rule-based, traditional machine learning-based, and deep learning-based approaches, with a focus on device fingerprints and application scenarios. Furthermore, main public datasets from the IoT, ICS, and IIoT scenarios are highlighted to support the development of fingerprinting and identification methods. Finally, several future research directions are proposed to guide new advancements in this area.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION; STATE ESTIMATION
AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are essential for reliable communication and control of smart grids. However, in the cyber-physical realm, it becomes highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks like False Data Injection (FDI) into the measurement signal which can circumvent the conventional detection methods and interfere with the normal operation of grids, which in turn could potentially lead to huge financial losses and can have a large impact on public safety. It is imperative to have an accurate state estimation of power consumption for further operational decision-making.This work presents novel forecasting-aided anomaly detection using an CNN-LSTM based auto-encoder sequence to sequence architecture to combat against false data injection attacks. We further present an adaptive optimal threshold based on the consumption patterns to identify abnormal behaviour. Evaluation is performed on real-time energy demand consumption data collected from the Australian Energy Market Operator. An extensive experiment shows that the proposed model outperforms other benchmark algorithms in not only improving the data injection attack (95.43%) but also significantly reducing the false positive rate.

AB We describe the architecture of an anomaly detection system based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for intrusion detection in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and especially in SCADA systems interconnected using TCP/IP. The proposed system exploits the unique characteristics of ICS networks and protocols to efficiently detect multiple attack vectors. We evaluate the proposed system in terms of detection accuracy using as reference datasets made available by other researchers. These datasets refer to real industrial networks and contain a variety of identified attack vectors. We benchmark our findings against a large set of machine learning algorithms and demonstrate that our proposal exhibits superior performance characteristics.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM
AB The term "Internet of Things" (IoT) refers to a system of networked computing devices that may work and communicate with one another without direct human intervention. It is one of the most exciting areas of computing nowadays, with its applications in multiple sectors like cities, homes, wearable equipment, critical infrastructure, hospitals, and transportation. The security issues surrounding IoT devices increase as they expand. To address these issues, this study presents a novel model for enhancing the security of IoT systems using machine learning (ML) classifiers. The proposed approach analyzes recent technologies, security, intelligent solutions, and vulnerabilities in ML IoT-based intelligent systems as an essential technology to improve IoT security. The study illustrates the benefits and limitations of applying ML in an IoT environment and provides a security model based on ML that manages autonomously the rising number of security issues related to the IoT domain. The paper proposes an ML-based security model that autonomously handles the growing number of security issues associated with the IoT domain. This research made a significant contribution by developing a cyberattack detection solution for IoT devices using ML. The study used seven ML algorithms to identify the most accurate classifiers for their AI-based reaction agent's implementation phase, which can identify attack activities and patterns in networks connected to the IoT. The study used seven ML algorithms to identify the most accurate classifiers for their AI-based reaction agent's implementation phase, which can identify attack activities and patterns in networks connected to the IoT. Compared to previous research, the proposed approach achieved a 99.9% accuracy, a 99.8% detection average, a 99.9 F1 score, and a perfect AUC score of 1. The study highlights that the proposed approach outperforms earlier machine learning-based models in terms of both execution speed and accuracy. The study illustrates that the suggested approach outperforms previous machine learning-based models in both execution time and accuracy.

ID ATTACKS
AB A fundamental expectation of the stakeholders from the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is its trustworthiness and sustainability to avoid the loss of human lives in performing a critical task. A trustworthy IIoT-enabled network encompasses fundamental security characteristics, such as trust, privacy, security, reliability, resilience, and safety. The traditional security mechanisms and procedures are insufficient to protect these networks owing to protocol differences, limited update options, and older adaptations of the security mechanisms. As a result, these networks require novel approaches to increase trust-level and enhance security and privacy mechanisms. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel approach to improve the trustworthiness of IIoT-enabled networks. We propose an accurate and reliable supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network-based cyberattack detection in these networks. The proposed scheme combines the deep-learning-based pyramidal recurrent units (PRU) and decision tree (DT) with SCADA-based IIoT networks. We also use an ensemble-learning method to detect cyberattacks in SCADA-based IIoT networks. The nonlinear learning ability of PRU and the ensemble DT address the sensitivity of irrelevant features, allowing high detection rates. The proposed scheme is evaluated on 15 datasets generated from SCADA-based networks. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms traditional methods and machine learning-based detection approaches. The proposed scheme improves the security and associated measure of trustworthiness in IIoT-enabled networks.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are becoming more and more important in managing the operation of many important systems in smart manufacturing, such as power stations, water supply systems, and manufacturing sites. While massive digital data can be a driving force for system performance, data security has raised serious concerns. Anomaly detection, therefore, is essential for preventing network security intrusions and system attacks. Many AI-based anomaly detection methods have been proposed and achieved high detection performance, however, are still a "black box" that is hard to be interpreted. In this study, we suggest using Explainable Artificial Intelligence to enhance the perspective and reliable results of an LSTM-based Autoencoder-OCSVM learning model for anomaly detection in ICS. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method based on a well-known SCADA dataset. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.

ID DEEP LEARNING APPROACH
AB As the technology is advancing more and more in the era of increasing digitalization, safeguarding networks from cyber threats is crucial. As cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure are becoming more and more sophisticated, enhancing cyber intrusion detection systems (IDS) is imperative. This paper proposes and evaluates a deep learning-based IDS using the NSL-KDD dataset, a benchmark for intrusion detection. The system pre-processes data with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and a Decision Tree classifier to identify the most significant features, optimizing model performance. Various deep learning models, including ANN, LSTM, BiLSTM, CNNLSTM, GRU, and BiGRU, have been evaluated. The CNN-LSTM model outperformed the others, with 95 % accuracy, 0.89 recall, and 0.94 f1-score. These results prove the effectiveness of the proposed IDS in accurately distinguishing between malicious and benign network traffic. Future research can explore ensemble techniques like boosting or bagging to further enhance IDS performance.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Providing security to the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is one of the demanding and crucial tasks in recent days, due to the different types of attacks on the network. For this purpose, there are different types of attack detection and classification methodologies have been developed in the conventional works. But it limits with the issues like high complexity in design, misclassification results, increased error rate, and reduced detection efficiency. In order to solve these issues, this paper aims to develop an advanced machine learning models for improving the SCADA security. This work comprises the stages of preprocessing, clustering, feature selection, and classification. At first, the Markov Chain Clustering (MCC) model is implemented to cluster the network data by normalizing the feature values. Then, the Rapid Probabilistic Correlated Optimization (RPCO) mechanism is employed to select the optimal features by computing the matching score and likelihood of particles. Finally, the Block Correlated Neural Network (BCNN) technique is employed to classify the predicted label, where the relevancy score is computed by using the kernel function with the feature points. During experimentation, there are different performance indicators have been used to validate the results of proposed attack detection mechanisms. Also, the obtained results are compared with the RPCO-BCNN mechanism for proving the superiority of the proposed attack detection system.

ID PREDICTION
AB The convergence of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has rendered ICS more vulnerable to a growing range of cyber-attacks, that put the critical infrastructures in danger. Some examples are the recent attacks on gas/oil and water treatment industries Existing attack detection methodologies primarily leverage machine learning techniques, often centralized in nature, raising concerns regarding data privacy and transfer challenges. In response, Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a distributed alternative, gaining traction in ICS attack detection. This paper introduces a deep federated multi -modal model for cyber-attack detection in ICS environments. The model encompasses three key components: representation learning for latent space transformation of original client data, domain adaptation to map client data to a public representation space, and a federated approach for training the cyber-attack detection model. To enhance interpretability, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method is employed to provide insights into model output results, aiding decision -making by cybersecurity experts. Experimental assessments reveal an average 8.2% improvement in f1 -score across three clients. Moreover, SHAP is applied for feature reduction, yielding a 4.9% f1 -score improvement with a halved feature set.

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are computer-based control architectures specifically engineered for the operation of industrial machinery via hardware and software models. These systems are used to project, monitor, and automate the state of the operational network through the utilization of ethernet links, which enable two-way communications. However, as a result of their constant connectivity to the internet and the lack of security frameworks within their internal architecture, they are susceptible to cyber-attacks. In light of this, we have proposed an intrusion detection algorithm, intending to alleviate this security bottleneck. The proposed algorithm, the Genetically Seeded Flora (GSF) feature optimization algorithm, is integrated with Transformer Neural Network (TNN) and functions by detecting changes in operational patterns that may be indicative of an intruder's involvement. The proposed Genetically Seeded Flora Transformer Neural Network (GSFTNN) algorithm stands in stark contrast to the signature-based method employed by traditional intrusion detection systems. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted using the WUSTL-IIOT-2018 ICS SCADA cyber security dataset. The results of these experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms such as Residual Neural Networks (ResNet), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in terms of accuracy and efficiency. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept adopted in nearly every aspect of human life, leading to an explosive utilization of intelligent devices. Notably, such solutions are especially integrated in the industrial sector, to allow the remote monitoring and control of critical infrastructure. Such global integration of IoT solutions has led to an expanded attack surface against IoT-enabled infrastructures. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated their ability to resolve issues that would have been impossible or difficult to address otherwise; thus, such solutions are closely associated with securing IoT. Classical collaborative and distributed machine learning approaches are known to compromise sensitive information. In our paper, we demonstrate the creation of a network flow-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aiming to protecting critical infrastructures, stemming from the pairing of two machine learning techniques, namely, federated learning and active learning. The former is utilized for privately training models in federation, while the latter is a semi-supervised approach applied for global model adaptation to each of the participant's traffic. Experimental results indicate that global models perform significantly better for each participant, when locally personalized with just a few active learning queries. Specifically, we demonstrate how the accuracy increase can reach 7.07% in only 10 queries.

AB Critical infrastructure (CI) typically refers to the essential physical and virtual systems, assets, and services that are vital for the functioning and well-being of a society, economy, or nation. However, the rapid proliferation and dynamism of today's cyber threats in digital environments may disrupt CI functionalities, which would have a debilitating impact on public safety, economic stability, and national security. This has led to much interest in effective cybersecurity solutions regarding automation and intelligent decision-making, where AIbased modeling is potentially significant. In this paper, we take into account "Rule-based AI"rather than other black-box solutions since model transparency, i.e., human interpretation, explainability, and trustworthiness in decision-making, is an essential factor, particularly in cybersecurity application areas. This article provides an in-depth study on multi-aspect rule based AI modeling considering human interpretable decisions as well as security automation and intelligence for CI. We also provide a taxonomy of rule generation methods by taking into account not only knowledge-driven approaches based on human expertise but also data-driven approaches, i.e., extracting insights or useful knowledge from data, and their hybridization. This understanding can help security analysts and professionals comprehend how systems work, identify potential threats and anomalies, and make better decisions in various realworld application areas. We also cover how these techniques can address diverse cybersecurity concerns such as threat detection, mitigation, prediction, diagnosis for root cause findings, and so on in different CI sectors, such as energy, defence, transport, health, water, agriculture, etc. We conclude this paper with a list of identified issues and opportunities for future research, as well as their potential solution directions for how researchers and professionals might tackle future generation cybersecurity modeling in this emerging area of study.

AB With the advent of the smart industry, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) moved from isolated environments to connected platforms to meet Industry 4.0 targets. The inherent connectivity in these services exposes such systems to increased cybersecurity risks. To protect ICSs against cyberattacks, intrusion detection systems (IDS) empowered by machine learning are used to detect abnormal behavior of the systems. Operational ICSs are not safe environments to research IDSs due to the possibility of catastrophic risks. Therefore, realistic ICS testbeds enable researchers to analyze and validate their IDSs in a controlled environment. Although various ICS testbeds have been developed, researchers' access to a low-cost, extendable, and customizable testbed that can accurately simulate ICSs and suits security research is still an important issue.In this paper, we present ICSSIM, a framework for building customized virtual ICS security testbeds in which various cyber threats and network attacks can be effectively and efficiently investigated. This framework contains base classes to simulate control system components and communications. Simulated components are deployable on actual hardware such as Raspberry Pis, containerized environments like Docker, and simulation environments such as GNS-3. ICSSIM also offers physical process modeling using software and hardware in the loop simulation. This framework reduces the time for developing ICS components and aims to produce extendable, versatile, reproducible, low-cost, and comprehensive ICS testbeds with realistic details and high fidelity. We demonstrate ICSSIM by creating a testbed and validating its functionality by showing how different cyberattacks can be applied.

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been designed with the assumption that the system would run within a closed environment. They have only generated concerns for security issues that may appear during system deployment, and there are no clear methods to assess security threats when considered. Recent technological and economic trends have driven SCADA systems from serial communication networks to networks based on TCP/IP. This exposes legacy SCADA systems to new security threats they were not designed to defend against. This work examines the viability of machine learning techniques in detecting new security threats specific to SCADA systems and the Modbus protocol. Machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithms were used to detect malicious traffic in a generated dataset of Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) communications using the Modbus protocol. The implemented algorithms are Support Vector Machines, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and k-means clustering. While the algorithms performed well overall, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, and K-nearest Neighbors algorithms had the best performance with individual attack types. K-means clustering did not perform satisfactorily with specific attack types.

AB Smart grid system is evident with control technologies and digital communications systems. The cyber-physical system is a critical infrastructure connected with complex drives and devices. The modern smart grid's prominent communication standard adopts high scalability, supports numerous communication devices' input/outputs, and has multi-vendor interoperability. Cyber-attack leads to an unstable power grid system and enormous economic loss. Throughout different cyber-attack, distributed denial of service attack is mostly destructive to smart grid infrastructure. This paper investigates smart grid cyber security systems and the communication vulnerabilities of other communication protocols. A comprehensive study on distributed denial of service attack techniques and detection approaches is present. Finally, examine a new hybrid machine learning-based distributed denial of service attack detection technique for a sustainable smart grid system. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A cyber-physical system (CPS) can be referred to as a network of cyber and physical components that communicate with each other in a feedback manner. A CPS is essential for daily activities and approves critical infrastructure as it provides the base for innovative smart devices. The recent advances in the field of explainable artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of robust intrusion detection modes for CPS environments. This study develops an Explainable Artificial Intelligence Enabled Intrusion Detection Technique for Secure Cyber-Physical Systems (XAIID-SCPS). The proposed XAIID-SCPS technique mainly concentrates on the detection and classification of intrusions in the CPS platform. In the XAIID-SCPS technique, a Hybrid Enhanced Glowworm Swarm Optimization (HEGSO) algorithm is applied for feature selection purposes. For intrusion detection, the Improved Elman Neural Network (IENN) model was utilized with an Enhanced Fruitfly Optimization (EFFO) algorithm for parameter optimization. Moreover, the XAIID-SCPS technique integrates the XAI approach LIME for better understanding and explainability of the black-box method for accurate classification of intrusions. The simulation values demonstrate the promising performance of the XAIID-SCPS technique over other approaches with maximum accuracy of 98.87%.

AB Nowadays, sustainability is the core of green technologies, being a critical aspect in many industries concerned with reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption optimization. While this concern increases, the number of cyberattacks causing sustainability issues in industries also grows. These cyberattacks impact industrial systems that control and monitor the right functioning of processes and systems. Furthermore, they are very specialized, requiring knowledge about the target industrial processes, and being undetectable for traditional cybersecurity solutions. To overcome this challenge, we present SUSAN, a Deep Learning-based framework, to build anomaly detectors that expose cyberattacks affecting the sustainability of industrial systems. SUSAN follows a modular and flexible design that allows the ensembling of several detectors to achieve more precise detections. To demonstrate the feasibility of SUSAN, we implemented the framework in a water treatment plant using the SWaT testbed. The experiments performed achieved the best recall rate (0.910) and acceptable precision (0.633), resulting in an F1-score of 0.747. Regarding individual cyberattacks that impact the system's sustainability, our implementation detected all of them, and, concerning the related work, it achieved the most balanced results, with 0.64 as the worst recall rate. Finally, a false-positive rate of 0.000388 makes our solution feasible in real scenarios.

AB A method referred to as PbNN is proposed to detect cyber-physical attacks through the identification of resulting anomalies in the process dynamics of the underlying ICS. Unlike existing anomaly detectors based on an abstract knowledge acquired from operational data, PbNN utilizes the design knowledge of ICS to learn the complex relationships among the correlated components. Such relationships are accurately modeled using operational data through the application of the deep convolution neural network. The proposed detector was implemented and evaluated in an operational secure water treatment plant by launching several real-time stealthy and coordinated attacks. The results indicate that PbNN outperforms the existing state-of-the-art machine learning anomaly detectors when compared using detection accuracy and the rate of false alarms.

ID ATTACK DETECTION
AB The essential role of intrusion detection is to manage the critical infrastructure to detect malicious activity competently concerning the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT network is used to communicate and control information among various components composing a critical system. The essential inclination of infrastructure swerves to confront security issues and challenges as network systems are examined to expose cyber-related threats. Additionally, accessing real-time information from the cloud leads to a massive problem of latency. Fog computing is a novel archetype to encompass the cloud to the network edge with practical computation and critical infrastructure. The fog layer makes the device vulnerable to numerous attacks because of rapid access to resources. The practical way of addressing these issues is to detect intrusions effectively and trace the path leading to the attack source. The intent of this paper is to present a security mechanism and assure truthful operation of IoT networks with the intrusion detection system. A network intrusion detection system is proposed based on the conception of the Exact Greedy Boosting ensemble method for device implementation in the fog node because of protecting critical infrastructure from timely and accurate detection of malicious activities. The proposed model explores the traffic flow monitoring in novel IoT Intrusion Dataset 2020(IoTID20) network traffic by identifying and classifying the type of attack based on anomalies from normal behavior. Further, the paper estimates the complete experimentation performance and evaluations with competitive machine learning algorithms. The experimental observation of the simulation work is evident in the proposed model's efficiency and robustness in categorizing the attacks.

AB In a critical infrastructure such as Smart Grid (SG), providing security of the system and privacy of consumers are significant challenges to be considered. The SG developers adopt Machine Learning (ML) algorithms within the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to monitor traffic data and network performance. This visibility safeguards the SG from possible intrusions or attacks that may trigger the system. However, it requires access to residents' consumption information which is a severe threat to their privacy. In this paper, we present a novel method to detect abnormalities on a large scale SG while preserving the privacy of users. We design a Federated IDS (FIDS) architecture using Federated Learning (FL) in a 5G environment for the SG metering network. In this way, we design Federated Deep Neural Network (FDNN) model that protects customers' information and provides supervisory management for the whole energy distribution network. Simulation results for a real-time dataset demonstrate the reasonable improvement of the proposed FDNN model compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The FDNN achieves approximately 99.5% accuracy, 99.5% precision/recall, and 99.5% f1-score when comparing with classification algorithms.

TI Analysis of Machine Learning Methods in EtherCAT-Based Anomaly Detection

AB Today, the use of Ethernet-based protocols in industrial control systems (ICS) communications has led to the emergence of attacks based on information technology (IT) on supervisory control and data acquisition systems. In addition, the familiarity of Ethernet and TCP/IP protocols and the diversity and success of attacks on them raises security risks and cyber threats for ICS. This issue is compounded by the absence of encryption, authorization, and authentication mechanisms due to the development of industrial communications protocols only for performance purposes. Recent zero-day attacks, such as Triton, Stuxnet, Havex, Dragonfly, and Blackenergy, as well as the Ukraine cyber-attack, are possible because of the vulnerabilities of the systems; these attacksare carried by the protocols used in communication between PLC and I/O units or HMI and engineering stations. It is evident that there is a need for robust solutions that detect and prevent protocol-based cyber threats. In this paper, machine learning methods are evaluated for anomaly detection, particularly for EtherCAT-based ICS. To the best of the authors knowledge, there has been no research focusing on machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection of EtherCAT. Before testing anomaly detection, an EtherCAT-based water level control system testbed was developed. Then, a total of 16 events were generated in four categories and applied on the testbed. The dataset created was used for anomaly detection. The results showed that the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and support vector machine with genetic algorithm (SVM GA) models perform best among the 18 techniques applied. In addition to detecting anomalies, the methods are able to flag the attack types better than other techniques and are applicable in EtherCAT networks. Also, the dataset and events can be used for further studies since it is difficult to obtain data for ICS due to its critical infrastructure and continuous real-time operation.

AB Deep Neural Networks based intrusion detection systems (DNN-IDS) have proven to be effective. However, in domains like critical infrastructure security, user trust on the DNN-IDS is imperative and high accuracy isn't sufficient. The black-box nature of DNNs hinders transparency of the DNN-IDS, which is necessary for building trust. The main objective of this work is to improve user trust by improving transparency of the DNN-IDS by making it more communicative. This paper presents a methodology to generate offline and online feedback to the user on the decision making process of the DNN-IDS. Offline, the user is reported the input features that are most relevant in detecting each type of intrusion by the trained DNN-IDS. Online, for each detection, the user is reported the inputs features that contributed most to the detection. The presented method was implemented on the KDD-NSL dataset with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based DNN-IDS. Binary and multi-class classification was carried out on the dataset. Further, several DNN-IDS architectures with different depth were tested to study the factors that drive classification. It was observed that despite showing very similar accuracy results, the factors that drove the decisions were different across architectures. This evidences that the qualitative analysis that is enabled through reporting relevant input features is important for the user to make a more informed decision in choosing a DNN-IDS. This online and offline feedback leads to improving the transparency of the DNN-IDS and helps build trust prior to and during deployment.

AB The prevalence of cyber-attacks perpetrated over the last two decades, including coordinated attempts to breach targeted organizations, has drastically and systematically exposed some of the more critical vulnerabilities existing in our cyber ecosystem. Particularly in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems with targeted attacks aiming to bypass signature-based protocols, attempting to gain control over operational processes. In the past, researchers utilized deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms to mitigate threats against industrial control systems (ICS). However, as technology evolves, these techniques become ineffective in monitoring and enhancing the cybersecurity defenses of those system against unwanted attacks. To address these concerns, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for anomaly detection in the SCADA network. Our model utilizes a "Q-network", which allows it to achieve state-of-the-art performance in pattern recognition from complex tasks. We validated our solution on two publicly available datasets. The WUSTL-IIoT-2018 and the WUSTL-IIoT-2021, each comprised of twenty-five networking features representing benign and attack traffic. The results obtained shows that our model successfully achieved an accuracy of 99.36% in attack detection, highlighting DRL's potential to enhance the security of critical infrastructure and laying the foundation for future research in this domain.

AB Cybersecurity incident response is a very crucial part of the cybersecurity management system. Adversaries emerge and evolve with new cybersecurity tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It is essential to detect the TTPs in a timely manner to respond effectively and mitigate the vulnerabilities to secure business operations. This research focuses on TTP identification and detection based on a machine learning approach. Early identification and detection are paramount in protecting, responding to, and recovering from such adversarial attacks. Analyzing use cases is a critical tool to ensure proper and in-depth evaluation of sector-specific cybersecurity challenges. In this regard, this study investigates existing known methodologies for cyber-attacks such as Mitre attacks, and developed a method for identifying threat cases. In addition, Windows-based threat cases are implemented, comprehensive datasets are generated, and supervised machine learning models are applied to detect threats effectively and efficiently. Random forest outperforms other models with the highest accuracy of 99%. Future work can be done for generating threat cases based on multiple log sources, including network security and endpoint protection device, and achieve high accuracy by removing false positives using machine learning. Similarly, real-time threat detection is also envisioned for future work.

DE Intrusion detection; Honeypots; Reinforcement learning; SARSA
AB Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are significant threats, especially to Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The honeypot is one of the most common approaches to protecting the network against such attacks. This study proposes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) called the state-action-reward-state -action (SARSA) for honeypot design. The proposed system using environmental experiments can achieve greater accuracy and convergence speed than traditional IDSs. Here, we use two types of agents, one for classification and the other for the environment. The environmental agent tries to minimize the rewards given to the classi-fying agent. Therefore, the classification agent is forced to learn the most complicated policies, increasing its learning capability in the long term. Thus, the proposed method improves the level of interaction for the early detection of honeypots by recording aggressive behavior. It can be especially suitable for very imbalanced datasets. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compare it with two categories of malicious ICS attacks, including MITM and DDoS. The results show that the proposed model is superior to traditional non-linear IDS models in terms of accuracy (<0.99) and F-measure (0.98).

AB Industrial control systems (ICSs) for critical infrastructure are extensively utilized to provide the fundamental functions of society and are frequently employed in critical infrastructure. Therefore, security of these systems from cyberattacks is essential. Over the years, several proposals have been made for various types of cyberattack detection systems, with each concept using a distinct set of processes and methodologies. However, there is a substantial void in the literature regarding approaches for detecting cyberattacks in ICSs. Identifying cyberattacks in ICSs is the primary aim of this proposed research. Anomaly detection in ICSs based on an artificial intelligence algorithm is presented. The methodology is intended to serve as a guideline for future research in this area. On the one hand, machine learning includes logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and decision tree (DT) algorithms, deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM), and the convolution neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) network to detect ICS malicious attacks. The proposed algorithms were examined using real ICS datasets from the industrial partners Necon Automation and International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). There were three types of attacks: man-in-the-middle (mitm) attack, web-server access attack, and telnet attack, as well as normal. The proposed system was developed in two stages: binary classification and multiclass classification. The binary classification detected the malware as normal or attacks and the multiclass classification was used for detecting all individual attacks. The KNN and DT algorithms achieved superior accuracy (100%) in binary classification and multiclass classification. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis method was presented to predict the error between the target and prediction values. The sensitivity analysis results showed that the KNN and DT algorithms achieved R2 = 100% in both stages. The obtained results were compared with existing systems; the proposed algorithms outperformed existing systems.

AB In recent times, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) experiences a high risk of cyber attacks which needs to be resolved. Blockchain technology can be incorporated into IIoT system to help the entrepreneurs realize Industry 4.0 by overcoming such cyber attacks. Although blockchain-based IIoT network renders a significant support and meet the service requirements of next generation network, the performance arrived at, in existing studies still needs improvement. In this scenario, the current research paper develops a new Privacy-Preserving Blockchain with Deep Learning model for Industrial IoT (PPBDL-IIoT) on 6G environment. The proposed PPBDLIIoT technique aims at identifying the existence of intrusions in network. Further, PPBDL-IIoT technique also involves the design of Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Neural Network (BiGRNN) technique for both detection and classification of intrusions in the network. Besides, CGO technique is applied to fine tune the hyper parameters in BiGRNN model. CGO algorithm is applied to optimally adjust the learning rate, epoch count, and weight decay so as to considerably improve the intrusion detection performance of BiGRNN model. Moreover, Blockchain enabled Integrity Check (BEIC) scheme is also introduced to avoid the misrouting attacks that tamper the OpenFlow rules of SDN-based IIoT system. The performance of the proposed PPBDL-IIoT methodology was validated using Industrial Control System Cyber-attack (ICSCA) dataset and the outcomes were analysed under various measures. The experimental results highlight the supremacy of the presented PPBDL-IIoT technique than the recent state-of-the-art techniques with the higher accuracy of 91.50%.

AB This paper proposes a deep learning-based multi-label classification approach to detect coordinated and simultaneously launched data falsification attacks on a large number of distributed generators (DGs). The proposed approach can detect coordinated additive, deductive, and combination of additive and deductive (attackers use the combination of additive and deductive attacks to camouflage their attacks) types of power output manipulation and falsification attacks on DGs. In training the proposed classifier, readings from DG meters and data from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems along with meteorological data are used as input and class labels (additive, deductive, and combination) are used as output. The output class labels are developed based on the comparison between normal and compromised outputs of DGs. Two parallel data falsification classifiers with separate class labels are developed to increase the detection accuracy. The proposed approach is demonstrated on several systems including a 240-node real distribution system (based in the USA) and the IEEE 123-node distribution test system. The results show that the proposed approach can detect low margin coordinated attacks (as low as 5% of actual DG readings) with up to 99.9% accuracy. The performance of the proposed work is compared with multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and residual neural network. All of the developed source codes (including unbalanced quasi-static power flow in OpenDSS-MATLAB environment and deep learning in Python) of the proposed solution are publicly available at GitHub.

AB An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) provides a front-line defense mechanism for the Industrial Control System (ICS) dedicated to keeping the process operations running continuously for 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week. A well-known ICS is the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. It supervises the physical process from sensor data and performs remote monitoring control and diagnostic functions in critical infrastructures. The ICS cyber threats are growing at an alarming rate on industrial automation applications. Detection techniques with machine learning algorithms on public datasets, suitable for intrusion detection of cyber-attacks in SCADA systems, as the first line of defense, have been detailed. The machine learning algorithms have been performed with labeled output for prediction classification. The activity traffic between ICS components is analyzed and packet inspection of the dataset is performed for the ICS network. The features of flow-based network traffic are extracted for behavior analysis with port-wise profiling based on the data baseline, and anomaly detection classification and prediction using machine learning algorithms are performed.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a key component of all advanced critical infrastructures. However, with the challenging nature of IoT, new security breaches have been introduced, especially against the Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL). Artificial-Intelligence-based technologies can be used to provide insights to deal with IoT's security issues. In this paper, we describe the initial stages of developing, a new Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning (ML) to detect routing attacks against RPL. We first simulate the routing attacks and capture the traffic for different topologies. We then process the traffic and generate large 2-class and multi-class datasets. We select a set of significant features for each attack, and we use this set to train different classifiers to make the IDS. The experiments with 5-fold cross-validation demonstrated that decision tree (DT), random forests (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) achieved good results of more than 99% value for accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score metrics, and RF has achieved the lowest fitting time. On the other hand, Deep Learning (DL) model, MLP, Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR) have shown significantly lower performance. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vulnerability detection in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network of a Smart Factory (SF) is a high-priority research area in the cyber-security domain. Choosing an efficient Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for intrusion detection is a huge challenge. This study performed an investigative analysis into the classification ability of various ML models leveraging public cyber-security datasets to determine the best model. Based on the performance evaluation, all adaptions of Decision Tree (DT) and KNN in terms of accuracy, training time, MCE, and prediction speed are the most suitable ML for resolving security issues in the SCADA system.

AB Fingerprinting of various physical and logical devices has been proposed for uniquely identifying users or devices of mainstream IT systems such as PCs, laptops, and smart phones. However, the application of such techniques in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is less explored for reasons such as a lack of direct access to such systems and the cost of faithfully reproducing realistic threat scenarios. This work addresses the feasibility of using fingerprinting techniques in the context of realistic ICS related to water treatment and distribution systems. A model-free sensor fingerprinting scheme (NoiSense) and a model-based sensor fingerprinting scheme (NoisePrint) are proposed. Using extensive experimentation with sensors, it is shown that noise patterns due to microscopic imperfections in hardware manufacturing can uniquely identify sensors with accuracy as high as 97%. The proposed technique can be used to detect physical attacks, such as the replacement of legitimate sensors by faulty or manipulated sensors. For NoisePrint, a combined fingerprint for sensor and process noise is created. The difference (called residual), between expected and observed values, i.e., noise, is used to derive a model of the system. It was found that in steady state the residual vector is a function of process and sensor noise. Data from experiments reveals that a multitude of sensors can be uniquely identified with a minimum accuracy of 90% based on NoisePrint. Also proposed is a novel challenge-response protocol that exposes more powerful cyber-attacks, including replay attacks.

   machine learning; poisoning attacks; adversarial robustness
AB Recently, neural network (NN)-based methods, including autoencoders, have been proposed for the detection of cyber attacks targeting industrial control systems (ICSs). Such detectors are often retrained, using data collected during system operation, to cope with the natural evolution (i.e., concept drift) of the monitored signals. However, by exploiting this mechanism, an attacker can fake the signals provided by corrupted sensors at training time and poison the learning process of the detector such that cyber attacks go undetected at test time. With this research, we are the first to demonstrate such poisoning attacks on ICS cyber attack online NN detectors. We propose two distinct attack algorithms, namely, interpolation- and back-gradient based poisoning, and demonstrate their effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world ICS data. We also discuss and analyze some potential mitigation strategies.

AB Recent years have witnessed a rise in the frequency and intensity of cyberattacks targeted at critical infrastructure systems. This study designs a versatile, data-driven cyberattack detection platform for infrastructure systems cybersecurity, with a special demonstration in the water sector. A deep generative model with variational inference autonomously learns normal system behavior and detects attacks as they occur. The model can process the natural data in its raw form and automatically discover and learn its representations, hence augmenting system knowledge discovery and reducing the need for laborious human engineering and domain expertise. The proposed model is applied to a simulated cyberattack detection problem involving a drinking water distribution system subject to programmable logic controller hacks, malicious actuator activation, and deception attacks. The model is only provided with observations of the system, such as pump pressure and tank water level reads, and is blind to the internal structures and workings of the water distribution system. The simulated attacks are manifested in the model's generated reproduction probability plot, indicating its ability to discern the attacks. There is, however, need for improvements in reducing false alarms, especially by optimizing detection thresholds. Altogether, the results indicate ability of the model in distinguishing attacks and their repercussions from normal system operation in water distribution systems, and the promise it holds for cyberattack detection in other domains.

AB In this paper we present a method to detect Man-in-the-Middle attacks on industrial control systems. The approach uses anomaly detection by developing a model of normal behaviour of the industrial control system network. To come as close as possible to reality a simple industrial system, a conveyor belt with sensors and actuators, was set up with controllers widely used in industry. A machine learning approach based on the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm with Bregman divergence was used to define a model of normal (valid) behaviour. Afterwards Man-in-the-Middle attacks were launched against the system and its behaviour during the attack was compared to the valid behaviour model. The results show that the approach taken was able to detect such attacks with satisfactory accuracy.

AB The need to update the electrical infrastructure led directly to the idea of smart grids (SG). Modern security technologies are almost perfect for detecting and preventing numerous attacks on the smart grid. They are unable to meet the challenging cyber security standards, nevertheless. We need many methods and techniques to effectively defend against cyber threats. Therefore, a more flexible approach is required to assess data sets and identify hidden risks. This is possible for vast amounts of data due to recent developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Due to adaptable base behavior models, machine learning can recognize new and unexpected attacks. Security will be significantly improved by combining new and previously released data sets with machine learning and predictive analytics. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data are used to learn more about the current situation and potential solutions for cybersecurity issues with smart grids. This article focuses on different types of attacks on the smart grid. Furthermore, it also focuses on the different challenges of AI in the smart grid. It also focuses on using big data in smart grids and other applications like healthcare. Finally, a solution to smart grid security issues using artificial intelligence and big data methods is discussed. In the end, some possible future directions are also discussed in this article. Researchers and graduate students are the audience of our article.

TI A Smart Factory Architecture Based on Industry 4.0 Technologies:
   Open-Source Software Implementation

AB The Smart Factory has been a concept studied during the last decade that has not been standardized yet; for this reason, the academy and industry have developed a wide variety of new architectures that describe the integration of elements for digitization and interconnection. The present research aims to introduce a new architecture proposal for migrating traditional (automation) to smart (digitization) factories, implemented through open-source software. The proposed architecture is integrated, for the first time, by the interconnection of six main elements: cyber-physical systems, edge computing, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data analytics, and cybersecurity; the research describes in detail their definitions, sub-elements, the interconnection between elements, and the minimum requirements for implementation. The test of the proposed smart factory was done through a scale smart factory pilot testing for a pick and place process, where the assembly of wood pieces from the geometric Tangram's puzzle was required; for this reason, the pilot testing includes a six-degree-of-freedom robot arm, a conveyor, a vision system, and a storage area. The case study conducted in this research allowed the assembly of four puzzles (fish, house, rocket, and swan) that were assembled with four different batches of pieces. The implementation allowed testing flexibility and adaptability. The final assembly reports included the status of assembly, the number of pieces assembled, the number of pieces stored, the assembly sequence, and the assembly time. Similarly, the development of the SCADA system allowed asset control as well as asset monitoring. The KPIs of the assembly process measured productivity (OTD) and time tracking (ATCT and TA) of the 16 tests, founding that the interconnection and digitization of the scale manufacturing cell were fully integrated and allowed repeatability; the proposed SF architecture represents an alternative for the small and medium automated factories to achieve interconnection and digitization, and it is ready to be tested in a more complex scenario.

AB A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system interconnection, virtualization and data exploitation, has emerged. Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently, the training of students and professionals has to address these new demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real automation. This course has been taught in a master's degree and students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey. The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the students' and faculty's viewpoint.

AB Security datasets with various operating characteristics and abnormal situations of industrial control system (ICS) are essential to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based control system security technology. In this study, we built a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)-based augmented ICS (HAI) testbed and developed ICS security datasets. Here, we introduce the second dataset (HAI 21.03), which was developed with the user feedback of the first released version (HAI 20.07). All HAI datasets are publicly available at https: //github.com/icsdataset/hai . HAI 21.03 was expanded by adding data points and normal/attack scenarios to HAI 20.07. We also held an AI-based anomaly detection contest (HAICon 2020) utilizing the HAI datasets developed so far, giving many AI researchers an opportunity to discuss and share ideas for ICS anomaly detection research. This paper presents the results of the HAICon 2020. The results of the top teams in the competition can be used as a performance comparison criterion when using HAI 21.03.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION; INTEGRITY ATTACKS; SYSTEM
AB The massive use of information technology has brought certain security risks to the industrial production process. In recent years, cyber-physical attacks against industrial control systems have occurred frequently. Anomaly detection technology is an essential technical means to ensure the safety of industrial control systems. Considering the shortcomings of traditional methods and to facilitate the timely analysis and location of anomalies, this study proposes a solution based on the deep learning method for industrial traffic anomaly detection and attack classification. We use a convolutional neural network deep learning representation model as the detection model. The original one-dimensional data are mapped using the feature mapping method to make them suitable for model processing. The deep learning method can automatically extract critical features and achieve accurate attack classification. We performed a model evaluation using real network attack data from a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The experimental results showed that the proposed method met the anomaly detection and attack classification needs of a SCADA system. The proposed method also promotes the application of deep learning methods in industrial anomaly detection.

AB Support vector machines (SVM) have been considered for real-life machine learning applications in various fields. Security concerns in modern industrial networks, also used in critical infrastructures, require novel monitoring techniques applicable for these constrained, real-time environments. Characteristics of these networks' traffic indicate that SVM can be a powerful tool for realizing a self-configuring monitoring for industrial infrastructures regarding attacks as kind of anomalies. This paper presents the experimental results of applying one-class SVM (OCSVM) on a number of real-world industrial traffic traces from very different industrial control systems (ICS). Initially focusing on a few network packet attributes, the results are discussed in terms of f-score, precision, and recall for different mappings of the features. The results demonstrate the high potential of using one-class SVM for monitoring packets and packet sequences in these networks.

AB The field of Cyber-Physical Industrial Internet of Things (CPS-IIoT) is rapidly developing, raising significant concerns about cyber-attacks due to the susceptibility of its devices and networking protocols. A breach in one device can compromise the entire system, necessitating robust security solutions. Existing methods fail to address the diversity and compatibility of CPS-IIoT environments. In this research, we propose a new privacy-preservation via Pearson correlation coefficient and agglomerative clustering with Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) integrated with a scaled dot-product attention for cyber-attacks detection in CPS-IIoT. The inclusion of agglomerative clustering and scaled dot product attention mechanism in our proposed system is a unique characteristic, specifically tailored for CPS-IIoT contexts. These mechanisms adaptively modify their emphasis to prioritize crucial features within the CPS-IIoT network traffic data, providing additional computational resources to data segments that are likely to include abnormalities and patterns that indicate security issues. We evaluated the performance of our proposed model by conducting experiments on two relevant datasets: UNSW-NB15, and a novel IIoT dataset named X-IIoTID. The X-IIoTID is a versatile intrusion data designed to accommodate the diversity and compatibility of Industrial IoT systems, regardless of their connectivity and device specifications. The data encompasses the actions of emerging IIoT connectivity protocols, recent device activities, a range of attack types and situations, as well as multiple attack protocols. We used a CPS-IIoT testbed that emulates a real industrial facility to demonstrate our proof of concept. Our system exhibits outstanding performance attaining 99.60% of accuracy, 100% of AUC, 97.98% of recall, 100% of precision, F1 of 98.23%, kappa of 96.07%, and Mathew correlation coefficient of 96.54% on UNSW-NB15. On the representative and realistic X-IIoTID data, our proposed system exhibits outstanding performance attaining 99.99% of accuracy, 100% of AUC, recall of 99.97%, 99.98% of precision, 99.87% of F1-score, 99.97% of kappa, and Mathew correlation coefficient of 99.98%. Additionally, we design SHAPley Additive exPlanations from eXplainable AI to enhance our proposed model interpretability and reliability. The findings revealed that the scaled dot product attention mechanism dramatically boosts model performance, while Pearson correlation and agglomerative clustering safeguard data privacy in CPS-IIoT, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Our model achieves 2.7% higher accuracy than TinyLSTM at only 11% higher energy cost, justifying its use in accuracy-critical CPS-IIoT scenarios.

AB Industrial control systems (ICSs) play a crucial role in managing and monitoring critical processes across various industries, such as manufacturing, energy, and water treatment. The connection of equipment from various manufacturers, complex communication methods, and the need for the continuity of operations in a limited environment make it difficult to detect system anomalies. Traditional approaches that rely on supervised machine learning require time and expertise due to the need for labeled datasets. This study suggests an alternative approach to identifying anomalous behavior within ICSs by means of unsupervised machine learning. The approach employs unsupervised machine learning to identify anomalous behavior within ICSs. This study shows that unsupervised learning algorithms can effectively detect and classify anomalous behavior without the need for pre-labeled data using a composite autoencoder model. Based on a dataset that utilizes HIL-augmented ICSs (HAIs), this study shows that the model is capable of accurately identifying important data characteristics and detecting anomalous patterns related to both value and time. Intentional error data injection experiments could potentially be used to validate the model's robustness in real-time monitoring and industrial process performance optimization. As a result, this approach can improve system reliability and operational efficiency, which can establish a foundation for safe and sustainable ICS operations.

AB With the growing concern about the security and privacy of smart grid systems, cyberattacks on critical power grid components, such as state estimation, have proven to be one of the top -priority cyber-related issues and have received significant attention in recent years. However, cyberattack detection in smart grids now faces new challenges, including privacy preservation and decentralized power zones with strategic data owners. To address these technical bottlenecks, this paper proposes a novel Federated Learning -based privacy -preserving and communication -efficient attack detection framework, known as FedDiSC , that enables Discrimination between power System disturbances and Cyberattacks. Specifically, we first propose a Federated Learning approach to enable Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition subsystems of decentralized power grid zones to collaboratively train an attack detection model without sharing sensitive power related data. Secondly, we put forward a representation learning -based Deep Auto -Encoder network to accurately detect power system and cybersecurity anomalies. Lastly, to adapt our proposed framework to the timeliness of real -world cyberattack detection in SGs, we leverage the use of a gradient privacy -preserving quantization scheme known as DP-SIGNSGD to improve its communication efficiency. Extensive simulations of the proposed framework on publicly available Industrial Control Systems datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve superior detection accuracy while preserving the privacy of sensitive power grid related information. Furthermore, we find that the gradient quantization scheme utilized improves communication efficiency by 40% when compared to a traditional federated learning approach without gradient quantization which suggests suitability in a real -world scenario.

AB Online food security and industrial environments and sustainability-related industries are highly confidential and in urgent need for network traffic analysis to attain proper security information to avoid attacks from anywhere in the world. The integration of cutting-edge technology such as the Internet of things (IoT) has resulted in a gradual increase in the number of vulnerabilities that may be exploited in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. In this research, we present a network intrusion detection system for SCADA networks that is based on deep learning. The goal of this system is to defend ICSs against network-based assaults that are both conventional and SCADA-specific. An empirical evaluation of a number of classification techniques including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forest (RF), convolution neural network (CNN), and integrated gated recurrent unit (GRU) is reported in this paper. The suggested algorithms were tested on a genuine industrial control system (SCADA), which was known as the WUSTL-IIoT-2018 and WUSTL-IIoT-20121 datasets. SCADA system operators are now able to augment proposed machine learning and deep learning models with site-specific network attack traces as a result of our invention of a re-training method to handle previously unforeseen instances of network attacks. The empirical results, using realistic SCADA traffic datasets, show that the proposed machine learning and deep-learning-based approach is well-suited for network intrusion detection in SCADA systems, achieving high detection accuracy and providing the capability to handle newly emerging threats. The accuracy performance attained by the KNN and RF algorithms was superior and achieved a near-perfect score of 99.99%, whereas the CNN-GRU model scored an accuracy of 99.98% using WUSTL-IIoT-2018. The Rf and GRU algorithms achieved >99.75% using the WUSTL-IIoT-20121 dataset. In addition, a statistical analysis method was developed in order to anticipate the error that exists between the target values and the prediction values. According to the findings of the statistical analysis, the KNN, RF, and CNN-GRU approaches were successful in achieving an R-2 > 99%. This was demonstrated by the fact that the approach was able to handle previously unknown threats in the industrial control systems (ICSs) environment.

AB In Industry 4.0, manufacturing and critical systems require high levels of flexibility and resilience for dynamic outcomes. Industrial Control Systems (ICS), specifically Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, are commonly used for operation and control of Critical Infrastructure (CI). However, due to the lack of security controls, standards, and proactive security measures in the design of these systems, they have security risks and vulnerabilities. Therefore, efficient and effective security solutions are needed to secure the conjunction between CI and I4.0 applications. This paper predicts potential cyberattacks and threats against CI systems by considering attacker motivations and using machine learning models. The approach presents a novel cybersecurity prediction technique that forecasts potential attack methods, depending on specific CI and attacker motivations. The proposed model's accuracy in terms of False Positive Rate (FPR) reached 66% with the trained and test datasets. This proactive approach predicts potential attack methods based on specific CI and attacker motivations, and doubling the trained data sets will improve the accuracy of the proposed model in the future.

AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are developed by the integration of computational algorithms and physical components and they exist as a result of technological advancement in embedded systems, distributed systems, and sophisticated networking technologies. Typically, these systems are intended to monitor and manipulate real-environment processes and objects. There had been advancements in CPS that affect various aspects of human lives and enable a wider range of applications and services. However, the interconnectivity between the cyber and physical world in CPS introduces new threats and security challenges and also increases the attack surface. The CPS is more prone to cyber-attacks than physical attacks because of the high accessibility of cyber components than physical ones. If we consider the last decade, it is no longer a myth to see industries relying on CPS being a victim of security attacks. In this paper, considering the applicability and dangers of CPS, we thus presented the key security aspects of CPS by reviewing published literature since 2018. We have examined the CPS requirements, challenges, security methods, security standards, threats, vulnerabilities, and past attacks. Moreover, we have considered the role of machine learning and deep learning in the enhancement of the security of CPS and reviewed the performance of existing works, and analyzed the challenges faced, and possible improvement techniques to enhance performance. We identified some key issues and challenges (such as CPS constraints, the performance of learning models, and security of learning models) in the adaption of learning-based methods for CPS security and accordingly proposed a security framework for CPS. Finally, several suggestions and recommendations are proposed considering the lessons learned from the comprehensive review.

AB Critical Infrastructures (CIs) are sensible targets. They could be physically damaged by natural or human actions, causing service disruptions, economic losses, and, in some extreme cases, harm to people. They, therefore, need a high level of protection against possible unintentional and intentional events. In this paper, we show a logical architecture that exploits information from both physical and cybersecurity systems to improve the overall security in a power plant scenario. We propose a Machine Learning (ML)-based anomaly detection approach to detect possible anomaly events by jointly correlating data related to both the physical and cyber domains. The performance evaluation showed encouraging results-obtained by different ML algorithms-which highlights how our proposed approach is able to detect possible abnormal situations that could not have been detected by using only information from either the physical or cyber domain.

AB In industrial control systems, industrial infrastructure is often attacked by hackers. Due to the serious sample imbalance in industrial control data, the traditional machine learning method has poor performance in anomaly detection. In this paper, TrAdaboost algorithm is applied to industrial control anomaly detection. The samples that are easy to classify are taken as the source domain data, and the samples with poor classification effect are taken as the target domain. The source domain data is used to guide the target domain data training. Then, we improve the traditional TrAdaboost algorithm from two aspects of initial weight and final classifier, and apply it to industrial control anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm on two different industrial control data sets is verified. And the improved algorithm is compared with other traditional algorithms. The experimental results show that the improved TrAdaboost algorithm has a significant advantage in predicting categories with a small sample size. This algorithm can accurately identify a few abnormal samples. Moreover, the F1 value, recall and precision value of the improved TrAdaboost algorithm on the two data sets have been significantly improved. This indicates that the improved TrAdaboost algorithm greatly improves the overall prediction accuracy of the model. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) underpin global critical infrastructure, including power, water, gas systems and smart grids. CPS, as a technology platform, is unique as a target for Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), given the potentially high impact of a successful breach. Additionally, CPSs are targets as they produce significant amounts of heterogeneous data from the multitude of devices and networks included in their architecture. It is, therefore, essential to develop efficient privacy-preserving techniques for safeguarding system data from cyber attacks. This paper introduces a comprehensive review of the current privacy-preserving techniques for protecting CPS systems and their data from cyber attacks. Concepts of Privacy preservation and CPSs are discussed, demonstrating CPSs' components and the way these systems could be exploited by either cyber and physical hacking scenarios. Then, classification of privacy preservation according to the way they would be protected, including perturbation, authentication, machine learning (ML), cryptography and blockchain, are explained to illustrate how they would be employed for data privacy preservation. Finally, we show existing challenges, solutions and future research directions of privacy preservation in CPSs.

TI Industrial Control Intrusion Detection Approach Based on
   Multiclassification GoogLeNet-LSTM Model
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB Intrusion detection is essential for ensuring the security of industrial control systems. However, conventional intrusion detection approaches are unable to cope with the complexity and ever-changing nature of industrial intrusion attacks. In this study, we propose an industrial control intrusion detection approach based on a combined deep learning model for communication processes that use the Modbus protocol. Initially, the network packets are classified as carrying information and noncarrying information based on key fields according to the communication protocol used. Next, a template comparison approach is employed to detect the network packets that do not carry any information. Furthermore, an approach based on a GoogLeNet-long short-term memory model is used to detect the network packets that do carry information. This approach involves network packet sequence construction, feature extraction, and time-series level detection. Subsequently, the detected intrusions are classified into multiple categories through a Softmax classifier. A gas pipeline dataset of the Modbus protocol is used to evaluate the proposed approach and compare it with existing strategies. The accuracy, false-positive rate, and miss rate are 97.56%, 2.42%, and 2.51%, respectively, thus confirming that the proposed approach is suitable for intrusion detection in industrial control systems.

AB Data-driven methods, such as deep learning, are widely adopted to detect cyberattacks for Industrial control systems (ICSs). Due to the neglect of entity spatial relationships (ESR), however, there is a potential discrepancy between the learned device topology and the real physical process. Meanwhile, existing methods confuse sensor patterns, actuator rules, and some interference within spatiotemporal dependence, suffering from undetected attack issue. To achieve precise detection without using design knowledge, we propose a sensor-actuator separated anomaly detection method (SA2) that distinguishes sensor patterns and actuator rules, constructing prediction models for sensors (PM-SEN) and actuators (PM-ACT) separately. Moreover, we propose an ESR-based topology construction method for providing process-conformed topology and an attack span-based evaluation method for validating the undetected attack issue. The experimental results show that SA2 outperforms all baselines in the F1 score, effectively detecting all attacks (zero undetected rate), compared to an optimal baseline with an undetected rate of close to 50%.

AB The pervasiveness in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to the application of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) has led to the growth of heterogeneous sensor data, thereby increasing the risk of intrusions and attacks. The existence and effect of intruders and their innovative attack techniques are on the rise. Existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) tend to be computationally expensive with this form of data due to the presence of noise. In real-time domains, available methods lag, necessitating additional research into effective feature extraction schemes, which is fundamental in machine learning (ML) for time exigency. This study, in a comparative analysis of some feature selection techniques (FS), proposes a combination of an efficient ML classifier and an agnostic FS scheme for attack detection and classification in a real-time SCADA network. The flexibility and interoperability of the proposed approach resolve the computational complexity of vulnerability detection schemes while reducing false alarm rates (FARs) and overall model execution time. With the view of an online preprocessing, the proposed technique is phased, thus: 1) data preparatory consisting of data cleansing and normalization followed by 2) the combination of a prepruned decision tree (DT) algorithm and an agnostic chi-square FS approach built to obtain an optimal subset of data features for efficient IDS; and 3) evaluation of proposed agnostic DT-CH and other FS candidates for anomaly detection.

AB Over the past few decades, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have been targeted by cyberattacks and are becoming increasingly vulnerable as more ICSs are connected to the internet. Using Machine Learning (ML) for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is a promising approach for ICS cyber protection, but the lack of suitable datasets for evaluating ML algorithms is a challenge. Although a few commonly used datasets may not reflect realistic ICS network data, lack necessary features for effective anomaly detection, or be outdated. This paper introduces the 'ICS-Flow' dataset, which offers network data and process state variables logs for supervised and unsupervised ML-based IDS assessment. The network data includes normal and anomalous network packets and flows captured from simulated ICS components and emulated networks, where the anomalies were applied to the system through various cyberattacks. We also proposed an open-source tool, "ICSFlowGenerator," for generating network flow parameters from Raw network packets. The final dataset comprises over 25,000,000 raw network packets, network flow records, and process variable logs. The paper describes the methodology used to collect and label the dataset and provides a detailed data analysis. Finally, we implement several ML models, including the decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural network to detect anomalies and attacks, demonstrating that our dataset can be used effectively for training intrusion detection ML models.

AB The highly beneficial contribution of intelligent systems in the industrial domain is undeniable. Automation, supervision, remote control, and fault reduction are some of the various advantages new technologies offer. A protocol demonstrating high utility in industrial settings, and specifically, in smart grids, is Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3), a multi-tier, application layer protocol. Notably, multiple industrial protocols are not as securely designed as expected, considering the highly critical operations occurring in their application domain. In this paper, we explore the internal vulnerabilities-by-design of DNP3, and proceed with the implementation of the attacks discovered, demonstrated through 8 DNP3 attack scenarios. Finally, we design and demonstrate a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based, multi-model Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), trained with our experimental network flow cyberattack dataset, and compare our solution with multiple machine learning algorithms used for classification. Our solution demonstrates a high efficiency in the classification of DNP3 cyberattacks, showing an accuracy of 99.0%.

AB Fundamental components of the distribution systems of electric energy are primary and secondary substation networks. Considering the incorporation of legacy communication infrastructure in these systems, they often have inherent cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Moreover, traditional intrusion defence strategies for IT systems are often not applicable. With the aim to improve cybersecurity in substation networks, in this paper we present two methods for monitoring SCADA system: the first one exploiting neural networks, while the second one is based on formal methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we conducted experiments on a real test bed representing the substation domain as close to real-world as possible. From this test bed we collect data during normal operation and during situations where the system is under attack. To this end several different types of attack are conducted. The data collected is used to test two versions of the monitoring system: one based on machine learning with a neural network and one using a model-checking approach. Moreover, the two proposed models are tested with new data to evaluate their performance. The experiments demonstrate that both methods obtain an accuracy greater than 90%. In particular, the methodology based on formal methods achieves better performance if compared to the one based on neural networks. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) for the Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is presented. The proposed IDPS is called DIDEROT (Dnp3 Intrusion DetEction pReventiOn sysTem) and relies on both supervised Machine Learning (ML) and unsupervised/outlier ML detection models capable of discriminating whether a DNP3 network flow is related to a particular DNP3 cyberattack or anomaly. First, the supervised ML detection model is applied, trying to identify whether a DNP3 network flow is related to a specific DNP3 cyberattack. If the corresponding network flow is detected as normal, then the unsupervised/outlier ML anomaly detection model is activated, seeking to recognise the presence of a possible anomaly. Based on the DIDEROT detection results, the Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology is adopted in order to mitigate timely the corresponding DNP3 cyberattacks and anomalies. The performance of DIDEROT is demonstrated using real data originating from a substation environment.

AB Recently, the importance of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems has grown for many industries around the world. These systems are controlling many vital infrastructures such as grids of power, plants, and water treatment systems. In fact, nowadays SCADA systems cannot be isolated from the public and thus being more vulnerable and exposed to many malicious attacks. Several studies have reviewed the latest developments in cyber-security risks for SCADA systems and found that many factors are responsible for increasing the amount and the level of risks on modern control systems. Among such factors are the network architecture and the reliance on standard technologies that have known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we attempt to improve a framework of SCADA system against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using three machine learning algorithms (i)J48; (ii) Naive Bayes; (iii) Random Forest to determine the attack patterns. These algorithms were trained and evaluated on KDDCup'99 dataset. The preprocessing phase of the dataset was conducted based on the goal of the paper and the obtained results showed that the best classification is obtained using Random Forest classifier (RF) with 99.99% accuracy rate, while Naive Bayes classifier has the lowest accuracy rate of 97.74%.

AB The cyber-physical security of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) represents an actual and worthwhile research topic. In this paper, we compare and evaluate different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for anomaly detection in industrial control networks. We analyze supervised and unsupervised ML-based anomaly detection approaches using datasets extracted from the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT), a testbed developed to emulate a scaled-down real industrial plant. Our experiments show strengths and limitations of the two ML-based anomaly detection approaches for industrial networks.

AB The inclusion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in industrial control systems (ICSs) has opened ICSs to several attack vectors, which are increasingly targeting critical infrastructure. Accurate detection and distinction between benign physical disturbances, malicious cyber-attacks, and malicious physical-attacks are necessary to protect critical infrastructure. While cyber sensors provide a useful tool to identify and mitigate cyber attacks, they often ignore the physical behavior of the system at hand. In this paper, we present a cyber-physical sensor called IREST (ICS Resilient Security Technology). The sensor takes a holistic approach in detecting anomalies by considering both cyber and physical disturbances in a complex system. The sensor was tested under different cyber-physical scenarios using the Idaho CPS SCADA Cybersecurity (ISAAC) testbed. The test scenarios capture different operational states of the CPS testbed, including various cyber and physical anomalies. The experiments show that the IREST sensor is able to detect both cyber and physical anomalies. The sensor has the benefit that training requires only normal data and is able to detect disturbances that have not been seen before. The presented approach provides a scalable framework for cyber-physical security research that can be expanded in the future.

AB Industrial Control System (ICS) is used to monitor and control critical infrastructures. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are major components of ICS, which are used to form automation system. It is important to protect PLCs from any attacks and undesired incidents. However, it is not easy to apply traditional tools and techniques to PLCs for security protection and forensics because of its unique architectures. Semi-supervised machine learning algorithm, One-class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), has been applied successfully to many anomaly detection problems. This paper proposes a novel methodology to detect anomalous events of PLC by using OCSVM. The methodology was applied to a simulated traffic light control system to illustrate its effectiveness and accuracy. Our results show that high accuracy of identification of anomalous PLC operations is obtained which can help investigators to perform PLC forensics efficiently and effectively.

AB Many computer-based devices are now connected to the internet technology. These devices are widely used to manage critical infrastructure such energy, aviation, mining, banking and transportation. The strategic value of the data and the information transmitted over the Internet infrastructure has a very high economic value. With the increasing value of the data and the information, the higher the threats and attacks on such data and information. Statistical data shows a significant increase in threats to cyber security. The Government is aware of the threats to cyber security and respond to cyber security system that can perform early detection of threats and attacks the internet.
   The success of a nation's cyber security system depends on the extent to which it is able to produce independently their cyber defense system. Independence is manifested in the form of the ability to process, analyze and create an action to prevent threats or attacks originating from within and outside the country. One of the systems can be developed independently is Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which is very useful for early detection of cyber threats and attacks.
   The advantages of an IDS is determined by its ability to detect cyber attacks with little false. This study learn how to implement a combination of various methods of machine-learning to the IDS to improve the accuracy in detecting attacks. This study is expected to produce a prototype IDS. This prototype IDS, will be equipped with a combination of machine-learning methods to improve the accuracy in detecting various attacks. The addition of machine-learning feature is expected to identify the specific characteristics of the attacks occurred in the Indonesian Internet network. Novel methods used and techniques in implementation and the national strategic value are becoming the unique value and advantages of this research.

AB With the development of deep learning and federated learning (FL), federated intrusion detection systems (IDSs) based on deep learning have played a significant role in securing industrial control systems (ICSs). However, adversarial attacks on ICSs may compromise the ability of deep learning-based IDSs to accurately detect cyberattacks, leading to serious consequences. Moreover, in the process of generating adversarial samples, the selection of replacement models lacks an effective method, which may not fully expose the vulnerabilities of the models. The authors first propose an automated FL-based method to generate adversarial samples in ICSs, called AFL-GAS, which uses the principle of transfer attack and fully considers the importance of replacement models during the process of adversarial sample generation. In the proposed AFL-GAS method, a lightweight neural architecture search method is developed to find the optimised replacement model composed of a combination of four lightweight basic blocks. Then, to enhance the adversarial robustness, the authors propose a multi-objective neural architecture search-based IDS method against adversarial attacks in ICSs, called MoNAS-IDSAA, by considering both classification performance on regular samples and adversarial robustness simultaneously. The experimental results on three widely used intrusion detection datasets in ICSs, such as secure water treatment (SWaT), Water Distribution, and Power System Attack, demonstrate that the proposed AFL-GAS method has obvious advantages in evasion rate and lightweight compared with other four methods. Besides, the proposed MoNAS-IDSAA method not only has a better classification performance, but also has obvious advantages in model adversarial robustness compared with one manually designed federated adversarial learning-based IDS method.

AB Satellite communications (Satcoms), whether ground-to-space or intersatellite, have, to date, primarily combined the two cutting-edge fields of communication and space, in which cybersecurity and space activities are intricately connected. The susceptibility of Satcoms and other space assets to cyberattacks, as a means of targeting critical infrastructure, is sometimes overlooked. Neither space nor cybersecurity policies, particularly for Satcoms systems, are equipped for the challenges posed by the convergence of space and cyberspace. With the rising number of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, Denial-of-Service (DoS), and zero-day attacks, on Satcoms systems by extreme nation-state attackers, further defenses must be established. These defenses should enable the discovery of zero-day attacks whilst reducing false positives associated with the detection of advanced persistent threats. In this article, to address these cyber concerns, a comprehensive deep federated learning (DFL)-based threat detection model for proactively recognizing intrusions in Satcoms networks using decentralized on-device data while preserving the privacy of this data is proposed. Our approach leverages a decentralized data-level preprocessing (DLP) mechanism, ensuring that original data remains concealed while providing well-processed, statistically transformed thought-out data for robust threat detection. The proposed model executes federated learning rounds on a novel deep auto-encoder (DAE) architecture, maintaining local data on secure warehouses, and sharing only the learned weights with the central FL server. Also, its ensemble mechanism aggregates the updates from multiple sources to optimize the accuracy of the global learning model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the classic/centralised learning (non-FL) versions in terms of protecting the privacy of local data and providing an optimal accuracy rate for attack detection. Furthermore, using differential privacy (DP)-based DLP as a privacy preservation mechanism, the proposed model exhibits high levels of accuracy and better levels of privacy over the training data.

AB Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) are highly dependent on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisi-tion (SCADA) for process monitoring and control. Such SCADA systems are known to communicate using various insecure protocols such as Modbus, DNP3, and Open Platform Communication (OPC) Data Access standards (providing access to real-time automation data), which are vulnerable to a range of attacks. This leads to increased cyber risks faced in critical infrastructures, especially in the Oil and Gas sector. One of the most popular and critical attacks deployed against such infrastructure is Denial of Service (DoS), as it can have severe consequences that range from financial loss to loss of life. Such attacks can disrupt the ability of an operator to control hazardous operations leading to potentially unsafe scenarios. A novel Field Flooding attack is described which takes advantage of the packet memory structure of the Modbus protocol to perform a DoS attack. This attack can cause overflowing of the memory bank allocated in the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) for Modbus operations. The attack is deployed and evaluated on a real industrial testbed and its impact against the Mitre ATT&CK framework is assessed, in order to identify which tactics an adversary could use to compromise the system. A novel mechanism that utilises supervised machine learning to detect this attack in industrial control system networks is also described. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism, using the XGBoost algorithm, can identify this attack with 99% accuracy.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Detecting intrusions from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems is one of the most essential and challenging processes in recent times. Most of the conventional works aim to develop an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) framework for increasing the security of SCADA against networking attacks. Nonetheless, it faces the problems of complexity in classification, requiring more time for training and testing, as well as increased misprediction results and error outputs. Hence, this research work intends to develop a novel IDS framework by implementing a combination of methodologies, such as clustering, optimization, and classification. The most popular and extensively utilized SCADA attacking datasets are taken for this system's proposed IDS framework implementation and validation. The main contribution of this work is to accurately detect the intrusions from the given SCADA datasets with minimized computational operations and increased accuracy of classification. Additionally the proposed work aims to develop a simple and efficient classification technique for improving the security of SCADA systems. Initially, the dataset preprocessing and clustering processes were performed using the multifacet data clustering model (MDCM) in order to simplify the classification process. Then, the hybrid gradient descent spider monkey optimization (GDSMO) mechanism is implemented for selecting the optimal parameters from the clustered datasets, based on the global best solution. The main purpose of using the optimization methodology is to train the classifier with the optimized features to increase accuracy and reduce processing time. Moreover, the deep sequential long short term memory (DS-LSTM) is employed to identify the intrusions from the clustered datasets with efficient data model training. Finally, the proposed optimization-based classification methodology's performance and results are validated and compared using various evaluation metrics.

AB Owing to the development of industrial production, the hidden danger in industrial control systems (ICSs) has considerably increased, causing challenges in traditional safety defense methods. The combination of machine-learning or deep-learning algorithms and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has become the mainstream method for solving this problem. However, these methods depend on a massive amount of high-quality attack traffic data, which cannot be obtained easily owing to the independence and unique characteristics of ICSs. In this study, we apply the reconstructed convolutional neural network and a data expansion algorithm named CenterBorderline_SMOTE (CB_SMOTE) to an IDS and propose data expansion intrusion detection system (DEIDS). The DEIDS is an end-to-end detection model that learns representative attack features from raw traffic and classifies them in a unified framework. Moreover, we adopt the classification activation map structure, which can deeply mine the potential characteristics of traffic and enhance the effectiveness of attack features. While enhancing the data quality, we introduce the designed CB_SMOTE algorithm into DEIDS to expand the data and solve the problem of insufficient attack data in the system. Our comprehensive experiments on different open datasets indicate that DEIDS achieves an excellent performance (97% detection accuracy) and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results also show that our method has high efficiency and high accuracy in processing ICSs datasets.

AB Technology has become an integral part of contemporary society. The current transition from an industrial so-ciety to an information society is accompanied by the implementation of new technologies in every part of human activity. Increasing pressure to apply ICT in critical infrastructure resulted in the creation of new vul-nerabilities. Traditional safety approaches are ineffective in a considerable number of cases. Therefore, machine learning another evolutionary step that provides robust solutions for extensive and sophisticated systems. The article focuses on cybersecurity research for industrial control systems that are widely used in the field of critical information infrastructure. Moreover, cybernetic protection for industrial control systems is one of the most important security types for a modern state. We present an adaptive solution for defense against cyber-attacks, which also consider the specifics of the industrial control systems environment. Moreover, the experiments are based on four machine learning algorithms (artificial neural network, recurrent neural network LSTM, isolation forest, and algorithm OCSVM). The proposed anomaly detection system utilizes multiple techniques and pro-cesses as preprocessing techniques, optimization techniques, and processes required for result interpretation. These procedures allow the creation of an adaptable and robust system that meets the need for industrial control systems.

AB This article explores the relationship between digital transformation and disaster risk. Vulnerability studies aim at differentiating impacts and losses by using fine-grained information from demographic, social, and personal characteristics of humans. With ongoing digital development, these characteristics will transform and result in new traits, which need to be identified and integrated. Digital transformations will produce new social groups, partly human, semi-human, or non-human-some of which already exist, and some which can be foreseen by extrapolating from recent developments in the field of brain wearables, robotics, and software engineering. Though involved in the process of digital transformation, many researchers and practitioners in the field of Disaster Risk Reduction or Climate Change Adaptation are not yet aware of the repercussions for disaster and vulnerability assessments. Emerging vulnerabilities are due to a growing dependency on digital services and tools in the case of a severe emergency or crisis. This article depicts the different implications for future theoretical frameworks when identifying novel semi-human groups and their vulnerabilities to disaster risks. Findings include assumed changes within common indicators of social vulnerability, new indicators, a typology of humans, and human interrelations with digital extensions and two different perspectives on these groups and their dependencies with critical infrastructure.

AB Oil and Gas organizations are dependent on their IT infrastructure, which is a small part of their industrial automation infrastructure, to function effectively. The oil and gas (O&G) organizations industrial automation infrastructure landscape is complex. To perform focused and effective studies, Industrial systems infrastructure is divided into functional levels by The Instrumentation, Systems and Automation Society (ISA) Standard ANSI/ISA-95:2005. This research focuses on the ISA-95:2005 level-4 IT infrastructure to address network anomaly detection problem for ensuring the security and reliability of Oil and Gas resource planning, process planning and operations management. Anomaly detectors try to recognize patterns of anomalous behaviors from network traffic and their performance is heavily dependent on extraction time and quality of network traffic features or representations used to train the detector. Creating efficient representations from large volumes of network traffic to develop anomaly detection models is a time and resource intensive task. In this study we propose, implement and evaluate use of Deep learning to learn effective Network data representations from raw network traffic to develop data driven anomaly detection systems. Proposed methodology provides an automated and cost effective replacement of feature extraction which is otherwise a time and resource intensive task for developing data driven anomaly detectors. The ISCX-2012 dataset is used to represent ISA-95 level-4 network traffic because the O&G network traffic at this level is not much different than normal internet traffic. We trained four representation learning models using popular deep neural network architectures to extract deep representations from ISCX 2012 traffic flows. A total of sixty anomaly detectors were trained by authors using twelve conventional Machine Learning algorithms to compare the performance of aforementioned deep representations with that of a human-engineered handcrafted network data representation. The comparisons were performed using well known model evaluation parameters. Results showed that deep representations are a promising feature in engineering replacement to develop anomaly detection models for IT infrastructure security. In our future research, we intend to investigate the effectiveness of deep representations, extracted using ISA-95:2005 Level 2-3 traffic comprising of SCADA systems, for anomaly detection in critical O&G systems.

AB The digitization of smart grid distributed generation and industrial control systems has prompted utilities to deploy tools with ubiquitous communications that potentially widen the attack surface. The utilities still continue to rely on the traditional cybersecurity technologies, such as firewalls, anti-malware tools, and passwords that do not ensure security across all dimensions of the information assurance model required for a strong cybersecurity business process. This paper proposes a multidimensional holistic framework that addresses this gap through advanced technologies, intelligent algorithms, and continued assessments. To show proof, the layered defense model, a solution dimension of the framework, is integrated into the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Security and Resilience Testbed to replicate a utility's enterprise and substation networks. The model is used to evaluate the security and resilience of microgrid control systems, and, based on the insights gathered, recommend best practices for utility cybersecurity analysts for a strong business process. With this baseline, the paper conceptually introduces intelligence-driven solutions comprising contextual data analysis and machine learning to respond to advanced persistent threats sponsored by campaign efforts.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly evolving, while introducing several new challenges regarding security, resilience and operational assurance. In the face of an increasing attack landscape, it is necessary to cater for the provision of efficient mechanisms to collectively detect sophisticated malware resulting in undesirable (run-time) device and network modifications. This is not an easy task considering the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of IoT environments; i.e., different operating systems, varied connected networks and a wide gamut of underlying protocols and devices. Malicious IoT nodes or gateways can potentially lead to the compromise of the whole IoT network infrastructure. On the other hand, the SDN control plane has the capability to be orchestrated towards providing enhanced security services to all layers of the IoT networking stack. In this paper, we propose an SDN-enabled control plane based orchestration that leverages emerging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classification models; a Deep Learning (DL) based architecture to combat malicious IoT nodes. It is a first step towards a new line of security mechanisms that enables the provision of scalable AI-based intrusion detection focusing on the operational assurance of only those specific, critical infrastructure components,thus, allowing for a much more efficient security solution. The proposed mechanism has been evaluated with current state of the art datasets (i.e., N_BaIoT 2018) using standard performance evaluation metrics. Our preliminary results show an outstanding detection accuracy (i.e., 99.9%) which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Based on our findings, we posit open issues and challenges, and discuss possible ways to address them, so that security does not hinder the deployment of intelligent IoT-based computing systems.

AB The integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques has significantly advanced Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) across diverse domains such as networking, cybersecurity and industrial control systems. These approaches have played a key role in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within IDSs. Moreover, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained prominence, encompassing both ML and AI capabilities. These models are trained on extensive datasets, enabling them to generate human-like text generation and autonomous decisions taking. This paper is intended to evaluate the capacity of LLMs in the context of IDSs for networking. LLMs exhibit the ability to process and comprehend large volumes of network log data, autonomously learn, adapt to evolving network behavior, and effectively differentiate between regular activities and potential threats. Emphasizing the substantial role of ML and AI by enhancing the adaptability and performance of IDSs technologies. The present work also underscores the potential of LLMs and their fine-tuning to reinforce IDSs capabilities, while addressing the associated challenges.

AB Intrusion detection in industrial control systems (ICS) is crucial for maintaining secu rity in modern industries. However, the rapid growth of data generated from various sources presents significant challenges, as complex and diverse attacks continue to threaten the integrity of these systems. Traditional intrusion detection systems face limitations in effectively detecting intrusions and suffer from processing delays. To address these issues, there is an urgent need for a real-time and efficient IDS. This study introduces a novel approach to real-time intrusion detection in ICS by leveraging Cloud Computing and Big Data techniques for data fusion. By fusing mul tiple streams of data, our approach enhances intrusion detection performance, reduces false alarm rates, and produces more consistent and accurate results. The contributions of this work are two-fold. Firstly, we propose a real-time IDS that overcomes the limitations of traditional systems through the efficient processing capabilities of Cloud Computing and Big Data techniques. Secondly, we employ data fusion to integrate diverse data sources, resulting in improved intrusion detection accuracy and efficiency. Our proposed IDS achieves higher accuracy rates and demonstrates superior efficiency in detecting intrusions compared to existing solutions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach in enhancing ICS security and mitigating risks posed by evolving attacks.

AB By violating semantic constraints that the control process impose, the semantic attack leads the Industry Control Systems (ICS) into an undesirable state or critical state. The spread of semantic attack has caused huge economic losses and casualties to critical infrastructure. Therefore, detecting semantic attack is referred to an urgent and critical task. However, few existing detecting techniques can achieve satisfactory effects in detecting semantic attack of ICS, due to the high requirements of complete critical state-based semantic behavior features description, joint detection on multivariate type state variables, and validity of field states datasets under semantic attacks. In an effort to deal with above challenges, We label device states databases with temporal characteristics and divide impacts on states of field devices under semantic attacks into three categories, including absent in states set, confused sequences, irregular frequency. On this basis, we establish a behavioral model based on secondary labeling of states-duration evolution graph (BMSLS), then implement an adaptive secure state-based semantic attack detection framework furtherly. Compared with the traditional Auto Regression (AR) algorithm, the newer time series correlation graph model, and other five deep learning algorithms, our proposed framework demonstrates the superior effect on the detection of semantic attack.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Industrial control systems (ICS) are considered cyber-physical systems that join both cyber and physical worlds. Due to their tight interaction, where humans and robots co-work and co-inhabit in the same workspaces and production lines, cyber-attacks targeting ICS can alter production processes and even bypass safety procedures. As an example, these cyber-attacks could interrupt physical industrial processes and cause potential injuries to workers. In this article, we present SafeMan, a unified management framework based on the Edge Computing paradigm that provides high-performance applications for the detection and mitigation of both cyber-attacks and safety threats in industrial scenarios. Three use cases show specific threats in manufacturing as well as the SafeMan actions carried out to detect and mitigate them. In order to validate our proposal, a pool of experiments was performed with Electra, an industrial dataset with normal network traffic and different cyber-attacks by using a given number of Modbus TCP and S7Comm devices. The experiments measured the runtime performance of anomaly detection techniques based on machine learning and deep learning to detect cyber-attacks in control networks. The experimental results show that Neural Networks report the best performance, being able to examine2(17)feature vectors per second over Electra, and therefore demonstrating that it can be used as detection model for SafeMan in real scenarios.

AB Modern industrial control systems (ICS) act as victims of cyber attacks more often in last years. These cyber attacks often can not be detected by classical information security methods. Moreover, the consequences of cyber attack's impact can be catastrophic. Since cyber attacks leads to appearance of anomalies in the ICS and technological equipment controlled by it, the task of intrusion detection for ICS can be reformulated as the task of industrial process anomaly detection. This paper considers the applicability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the field of industrial processes anomaly detection. Existing approaches for GANs usage in the field of information security (such as anomaly detection in network traffic) were described. It is proposed to use the BiGAN architecture in order to detect anomalies in the industrial processes. The proposed approach has been tested on Secure Water Treatment Dataset (SWaT). The obtained results indicate the prospects of using the examined method in practice.

DE Anomaly detection (AD); machine learning (ML); signal integrity (SI)
AB Evaluating the robustness of integrated circuits (ICs) against noise and disturbances is of crucial importance in signal integrity (SI) applications. In this paper, the addressed challenge is to build a software-based framework allowing for automated detection of failures and fast simulation-based evaluation of designs. In particular, these tasks are here addressed using anomaly detection (AD), a branch of machine learning (ML) techniques focused on identifying erroneous or deviant data. In the proposed framework, the ML model only requires the time-domain waveforms and no additional knowledge about the circuit nor about the errors to be identified. Specifically, a two-step approach to detect anomalous behaviors in output waveforms of digital ICs is proposed, comprising a first phase where the ML models are trained to learn relevant features describing the data and a second one where those features are used to identify anomalies with unsupervised or semisupervised AD techniques. Two relevant application examples validate the performance and flexibility of the proposed method.

AB The paper addresses machine learning methods, utilizing data from industrial control systems, that are suitable for detecting anomalies in the press hardening process of automotive components. The paper is based on a survey of methods for anomaly detection in various applications. Suitable methods for the press -hardening process are implemented and evaluated. The result shows that it is possible to implement machine learning for anomaly detection by non -machine learning experts utilizing readily available programming libraries/APIs. The three evaluated methods for anomaly detection in the press -hardening process all perform well, with the autoencoder neural network scoring highest in the evaluation. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Smart grid (SG) engages bidirectional energy and data flow with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and lures attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the critical infrastructure. Of the existing cyber threats, one of the major attacks is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack which eavesdrops and interrupts the communication between smart meter (SM) and data concentrator (DC) thereby paving the way for other cyber threats. Though many research works dealt with the solution to this attack, the majority of them are either simulation based or not intended for AMI. Hence, the proposal aims to develop a robust machine learning (ML) based intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect the attack in the real-time infrastructure. To attain this, AMI is setup using lamp loads, resistive loads, sensors, AtMega controller, Raspberry Pi, and a Server using the communication protocols namely Modbus TCP/IP and message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT). Then, the attack is emulated using Ettercap in a real-time testbed. The packets are captured with Wireshark and processed using preprocessing methods in Python. Furthermore, a pool of ML algorithms is extensively trained and validated on the practical testbed to identify suitable intrusion detection models. The results exhibit that the random forest (RF) algorithm outperforms the rest of the algorithms. Furthermore, to optimize its performance, the conventional RF algorithm is blended with a modified hybrid bat algorithm (HBA). The performance metrics of the hybrid model exhibit its supremacy over its counterparts.

AB The study in this paper characterizes lightweight IoT networks as being established by devices with few computer resources, such as reduced battery life, processing power, memory, and, more critically, minimal security and protection, which are easily vulnerable to DDoS attacks and propagating malware. A DDoS attack detection model is crucial for attacks in various industries, ensuring the availability and reliability of their networks and systems. The model distinguishes between legitimate and malicious traffic by analyzing network traffic patterns and identifying anomalies. This safeguards critical infrastructure, preserves business continuity, and protects the user experience, minimizing the impact of DDoS attacks. Numerous scholars have studied the notion that protecting lightweight IoT networks essentially requires improving intrusion detection systems. This research is valuable, as it follows a tailored pre-processing methodology specific to IoT network challenges, addressing a pressing need in cybersecurity by focusing on a growing concern related to IoT devices and DDoS attacks, enhancing the security of essential network systems in various industries by effectively detecting DDoS attacks, and developing a lightweight intrusion detection system that aligns with the limited resources of IoT devices. This manuscript proposes a compact and lightweight intrusion detection system that blends machine learning classifiers with a fresh approach to data pre-processing. The handling of missing values, data standardization using Standard Scalar, feature selection using ExtraTreeClassifier wherein only the 15 best features are extracted, and anomaly detection using a classifier are performed. The network dataset of TON-IOT and BOT-IOT datasets is used for experiments, specifically binary classifications and multiple-class classification for the experiment with DDoS and all attacks, respectively. There is an imbalance between the TON-IOT and BOT-IOT attack classes. In trials using the TON-IOT and BOT-IOT datasets, the classes were balanced using several iterations of the SMOTE approach. This research provides a number of classifier types, namely logistic regression, random forest, naive bayes, artificial neural network, and k nearest neighbor algorithms, which are used to build a lightweight intrusion detection system that is ideally suited for protecting against DDoS attacks in IoT networks. The time taken to train and predict the DDoS attacks is also implemented. Random forest performed well under TON-IOT and naive bayes performed well under BOT-IOT under binary and multiple-class classification, achieving an accuracy of 100% with less training and prediction time.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION
AB The security analysis has become the hotspot concern in Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) that grabs the research attention in today's era. Owing to the rapid admittance of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the super-imposition of fog and cloud computing plays a pivotal role for rectifying such issues as fewer computation re-sources and more latency in the network. In addition to this, security issue comes first while developing the ICS in the sector of IIoT. In general, ICS is applied for various processes, such as electric utilization and water supply management, that are related to every individual's life. Though it is interlinked with the Internet, it can easily expose to different threats. To defend the model, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are employed. In signature -based detection, anomaly detection is used to find out the unknown attacks in the network. Yet, the ICS is structured with many software and hardware tools. It also seems in the openness nature of the industrial environment that, it becomes vulnerable to various attacks. Hence, detecting unknown attacks is a complex task in the openness nature of the industrial environment. It causes failure to protect such systems from malicious entities that could result in more complications for humans. Hence, the detection of malicious activities is essential. In order to provide an efficient model, a new hybrid deep learning is proposed in ICS. Initially, the original data is to be collected based on the ICS industry. Secondly, the gathered data is preprocessed to clean the artifacts and clean the data. Thirdly, the optimal features are chosen directly from the gathered data with the help of a hybrid algorithm called the Hybrid Honey Badger-World Cup Algorithm (HHB-WCA). The chosen optimal features are fed to the hybrid deep learning termed as Autoencoder-Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (A-Bi-LSTM), where the encoded features from Autoencoder are extracted and encoded features are subjected to the Bi-LSTM classifier. Finally, the simulation outcome has shown that the developed method is compared with the other traditional algorithms to detect the unknown classes in the network.

AB Due to the continuous evolution of adversary tactics, strategies, and processes, the contemporary digital universe is confronted with new obstacles in defending digital assets ranging from secret information to essential infrastructure. The advanced persistent threat (APT) is a new attack methodology used by modern adversaries in which the attacker employs sophisticated and highly evasive exploits and payloads to achieve long-term persistence and lateral movement to accomplish objectives such as high endurance data collection, disruption, or denial of critical infrastructure services. The payloads employed in these sorts of attacks are sophisticated and include advanced approaches for evading contemporary security solutions that depend heavily on signature and rule-based detection methods. Nowadays, individuals rely on behavior analysis combined with artificial intelligence approaches to determine given sample is malicious or not. This paper presents an innovative multi-dimensional hybrid Bayesian belief network model to classify the given sample as malicious or benign in the APT malware detection domain. It is a hybrid method of three analytical models: static analysis Bayesian belief network (SABBN), dynamic analysis Bayesian belief network (DABBN), and event analysis Bayesian belief network (EABBN) that covers the vast range of malware behavioral traits. The suggested framework detects APT Malware with 92.62 percent accuracy and a 0.0538 percent false-positive rate, which is excellent in an area where security solutions lack trustworthy mechanisms.

AB At present, specific voice control has gradually become an important means for 5G-Internet-of-Things-aided industrial control systems, such as controlling the operation and adjustment of industrial Internet of Things equipment through telephone voice of the controller. However, the security of specific voice control system needs to be improved, because the voice cloning technology based on transfer learning can easily simulate the voice of the controller, which may lead to industrial accidents and other potential security risks. Therefore, this article mainly aims to study and understand the principle of voice cloning attack technology, putting forward a voice clone attack method, in order to prepare for the construction of a specific voice recognition system in the future. At present, the key technology of voice cloning attack is how to solve the problem that the target speaker's personalized speech with high quality cannot be synthesized under small samples. In fact, voice cloning is a very challenging problem because speech is more difficult to be represented in the hidden space of the model. We propose a transductive voice transfer learning method to learn the predictive function from the source domain and fine-tune in the target domain adaptively. The target learning task and the source learning task are both synthesizing speech signals from the given audio, while the datasets of both domains are different. By adding different penalty values to each instances and minimizing the expected risk, an optimal precise model can be learned. In addition, an evaluation method to verify the audio similarity of the target speaker was given to show the similarity between the synthesized audio and the original audio. Many details of the experimental results show that our method can effectively synthesize the speech of the target speaker with small samples.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB A cyber attack launched on a critical infrastructure (CI), such as a power grid or a water treatment plant, could lead to anomalous behavior. There exist several methods to detect such behavior. This paper reports on a study conducted to compare two methods for detecting anomalies in CI. One of these methods, referred to as design-centric, generates invariants from the design of a CI. Another method, referred to as data-centric, generates the invariants from data collected from an operational CI. The key question that motivated the study is "How do design and data-centric methods compare in the effectiveness of the generated invariants in detecting process anomalies." The data-centric approach used Association Rule Mining for generating invariants from operational data. These invariants, and their performance in detecting anomalies, was compared against those generated by a design-centric approach reported in the literature. The entire study was conducted in the context of an operational scaled down version of a water treatment plant. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the increasing deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) in various domains (e.g., smart buildings and critical infrastructure protection), the limited capabilities on such devices introduce significant security vulnerabilities, especially when considering their integration with Software Defined Network (SDN) to provide flexible services. In this paper, we investigate efficient attack detection techniques for such software-defined IoT (SD-IoT) networks. First, we simulate commonly utilized attacks, such as SYN, ping flood, UDP port scan and UDP flood, using Mininet-WiFi for a given SD-IoT topology and collect representative datasets with Wireshark. Then, focusing on Random Forest (RF) machine learning models, we study the effects of various feature sets (e.g., IPs and ports) on the detection accuracy for different attacks. Moreover, the effects of RF configurations (i.e., forest size and tree depth) on the detection accuracy and run-time overheads are also evaluated. In addition to our collected datasets, two known IoT datasets were also used. The results show that RF can achieve high detection accuracy with the selected feature sets for the considered attacks. Moreover, the detection accuracy of RF decreases only slightly with reduced forest sizes (e.g., fewer trees or less depth) where the run-time overheads can be significantly reduced. This demonstrates the utility of the studied techniques in resource-constrained IoT networks.

AB Industry 4.0 is a new concept, thus risk assessment is necessary. Several risk assessment methods for Industrial Control System (ICS) and Industry 4.0 have been proposed, however, it is difficult to identify impacts on the physical world caused by cyber attacks against ICS since many of these are based on tabletop analysis or software simulations. Therefore, we focus on the risk assessment using actual machines (ICS testbed) which can help to solve the above problems. In Industry 4.0, autonomous judgment and execution are required for the cyber-physical system, it is based on information exchange using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud technologies. In this research, we evaluate cyber risks through attacks against ICS with AI and cloud using ICS testbed. The proposed method can clarify cyber risks and impacts on the real world, and corresponding countermeasures.

AB With the rapid application of the network based communication in industries, the security related problems appear to be inevitable for automation networks. The integration of internet into the automation plant benefited companies and engineers a lot and on the other side paved ways to number of threats. An attack on such control critical infrastructure may endangers people's health and safety, damage industrial facilities and produce financial loss. One of the approach to secure the network in automation is the development of an efficient Network based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Despite several techniques available for intrusion detection, they still lag in identifying the possible attacks or novel attacks on network efficiently. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of detection mechanism by combining the deep learning techniques with the machine learning techniques for the development of Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The performance metrics such as precession, recall and F-Measure were measured.

AB The emergence of cyber-physical smart grid (CPSG) systems has revolutionized the traditional power grid by enabling the bidirectional energy flow between consumers and utilities. However, due to escalated information exchange between the end-users, it has posed a greater challenge to the cyber security mechanisms for the communication networks at the cyber and physical planes. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian approach integrated with deep convolutional neural networks (CNN-Bayesian). While, the Bayesian component is used to discriminate cyber-physical intrusions from the normal events in the binary and multi-class events. CNN layers are utilized to handle the high-dimensional feature space prior to the intrusions classification task. The proposed method is validated using real-time Industrial control systems (ICS) dataset against the standard deep learning-based classification methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM). From the experimental results, it can be inferred that the proposed CNN-Bayesian method outperforms the existing benchmark classification methods to discriminate intrusions in CPSG systems using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1-score.

AB Recently, Critical Infrastructures (CI) such as energy, power, transportation, and communication have come to be increasingly dependent on advanced information and communication technology (ICT). This change has increased the connection between the Industrial Control System (ICS) supporting the CI and the Internet, resulting in an increase in security threats and allowing a malicious attacker to manipulate and control the ICS arbitrarily. On the other hand, ICS operators are reluctant to install security systems for fear of adverse effects on normal operations due to system changes. Therefore, new research is needed to detect anomalies quickly and identify attack types while ensuring the high availability of ICS. This study proposes a host-based method to detect and identify abnormalities in an Oil Refinery's Distributed Control System (DCS) network using DCS vendor-proprietary protocols using a proposed method based on the tree-based machine learning algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect an abnormality with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) classifier, with up to 99% accuracy. Taken together, the results of this study contribute to the accurate detection of abnormal events and identification of attack types on the network without disrupting the normal operation of the DCS in the Oil Refinery.

AB Reliability and security of power distribution and data traffic in smart grid (SG) are very important for industrial control systems (ICS). Indeed, SG cyber-physical connectivity is subject to several vulnerabilities that can damage or disrupt its process immunity via cyberthreats. Today???s ICSs are experiencing highly complex data change and dynamism, increasing the complexity of detecting and mitigating cyberattacks. Subsequently, and since Machine Learning (ML) is widely studied in cybersecurity, the objectives of this paper are twofold. First, for algorithmic simplicity, a small-scale ML algorithm that attempts to reduce computational costs is proposed. The algorithm adopts a neural network with an augmented hidden layer (NAHL) to easily and efficiently accomplish the learning procedures. Second, to solve the data complexity problem regarding rapid change and dynamism, a label autoencoding approach is introduced for Embedding Labels in the NAHL (EL-NAHL) architecture to take advantage of labels propagation when separating data scatters. Furthermore, to provide a more realistic analysis by addressing real-world threat scenarios, a dataset of an electric traction substation used in the high-speed rail industry is adopted in this work. Compared to some existing algorithms and other previous works, the achieved results show that the proposed EL-NAHL architecture is effective even under massive dynamically changed and imbalanced data.

AB An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a tool used primarily for security monitoring, which is one of the security strategies for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Distributed Network Protocol version 3 (DNP3) is the predominant SCADA protocol in the energy sector. In this paper, we have developed an effective and flexible IDS for DNP3 networks, observing that most critical operations in DNP3 systems are utilized based on the function codes in DNP3 application messages, and that exploitation of those function codes enables attackers to manipulate the system operation. Our proposed anomaly-detection method deals with possible attacks that can bypass any rule-based deep packet inspection once attackers take over servers in the system. First, we generated datasets that reflected DNP3 traffic characteristics observed in real-world power grid substations for a reasonably long time. Next, we extracted input features that consisted of the occurrences of function codes per TCP connection, along with TCP characteristics. We then used an unsupervised deep learning model (Autoencoder) to learn the normal behavior of DNP3 traffic based on function code patterns. We called our approach FC-AE-IDS (Function Code Autoencoder IDS). The evaluation of the proposed method was carried out on three different datasets, to prove its accuracy and effectiveness. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we performed various experiments that resulted in more than 95% detection accuracy for all considered attack scenarios that are mentioned in this study. We compared our approach to an IDS that is based on traditional features, to show the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Industrial control systems (ICS) are the backbone for the implementation of cybersecurity solutions. They are susceptible to various attacks, due to openness in connectivity, unauthorized attempts, malicious attacks, use of more commercial off the shelf (COTS) software and hardware, and implementation of Internet protocols (IP) that exposes them to the outside world. Cybersecurity solutions for Information technology (IT) secured with firewalls, intrusion detection/protection systems do nothing much for Operational technology (OT) ICS. An innovative concept of using real operational technology network traffic-based testbed, for cyber-physical system simulation and analysis, is presented. The testbed is equipped with real-time attacks using in-house penetration test tool with reconnaissance, interception, and firmware analysis scenarios. The test cases with different real-time hacking scenarios are implemented with the ICS cyber test kit, and its industrial datasets are captured which can be utilized for Deep packet inspection (DPI). The DPI provides more visibility into the contents of OT network traffic based on OT protocols. The Machine learning (ML) techniques are deployed for cyber-attack detection of datasets from the cyber kit. The performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score are evaluated and cross validated for different ML algorithms for anomaly detection. The decision tree (DT) ML technique is optimized with pruning method which provides an attack detection accuracy of 96.5%. The deep learning (DL) techniques has been used recently for enhanced OT intrusion detection performances.

AB Legacy industrial control systems (ICSs) are not designed to be exposed to the Internet and linking them to corporate networks has introduced a large number of cyber security vulnerabilities. Due to the distributed nature of ICS devices, a detection-in-depth strategy is required to simultaneously monitor the behaviour of multiple sources of ICS data. While a detection-in-depth method leads to detecting attacks, like flooding attacks in earlier phases before the attacker can reach the end target, most research papers have focused on anomaly detection based on a single source of ICS data. Here, we present a detection-in-depth method for an ICS network. The new method is called automated flooding attack detection (AFAD) which consists of three stages: data acquisition, pre-processing, and a flooding anomaly detector. Data acquisition includes data collection from different sources like programmable logic controller (PLC) logs and network traffic. We then generate NetFlow data to provide light-weight anomaly detection in ICS networks. NetFlow-based analysis has been used as a scalable method for anomaly detection in high-speed networks. It only analyses packet headers, and it is an efficient method for detecting flooding attacks like denial of service attacks, and its performance is not affected by encrypted data. However, it has not been sufficiently studied in industrial control systems. Besides NetFlow data, ICS device logs are a rich source of information that can be used to detect abnormal behaviour. Both NetFlow traffic and log data are processed in our pre-processing stage. The third stage of AFAD is anomaly detection which consists of two parallel machine learning analysis methods, which respectively analyse the behaviours of device logs and NetFlow records. Due to the lack of enough labelled training datasets in most environments, an unsupervised predictor and an unsupervised clustering method are respectively used in the anomaly detection stage. We validated our approach using traffic captured in a factory automation dataset, Modbus dataset, and SWAT dataset. These datasets contain physical and network level normal and abnormal data. The performance of AFAD was compared with single-layer anomaly detection and with other studies. Results showed the high precision of AFAD in detecting flooding attacks.

AB Recent studies imply that despite having a high level of security features and accurate algorithms, Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are vulnerable to False Data Injection (FDI) in the measurements. These FDIs could be: 1) an intentional FDI Attack (FDIA) or 2) unintentional errors resulting from limited precision, communication medium, noise, etc. Traditional false data detection techniques that use SCADA measurements in conjunction with the PMU measurements are insufficient to detect malicious data in PMU measurements. Thus, a new approach is proposed in this paper, which can detect the presence of false data in the PMU measurements and correct them, without relying on the use of the SCADA measurements. An affine relationship between the sparsely placed PMUs, based on the AC model of the network, is statistically extracted by offline training of a support vector regressor. This relationship is further used for the real-time detection and correction of false data in the PMU measurements. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 118 bus system and the Northern Regional Power Grid (NRPG) of India for detecting intentional as well as unintentional false data in single and multiple PMU measurements. Numerical results, thus obtained after testing synthetic and real-world data, are also compared with existing approaches, which justify and prove the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB Cyber-physical critical infrastructures such as power plants are no longer air-gapped. Due to IP-Convergence, the control systems and sensor/actuator communication networks are often directly or indirectly connected to the Internet. While network intrusion detection can provide certain cyber defense capabilities, that is not sufficient due to covert attacks or insider attacks. Therefore, in recent years, a lot of research is being carried out to detect intrusion by observing anomalies in the plants' physical dynamics. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection mechanism based on a semi-supervised machine learning technique allowing us near real-time localization of attacks. Deep neural network architecture is used to detect anomaly - based on reconstruction error. We demonstrate our method's efficacy on the SWaT dataset. Our method outperforms other existing anomaly detection techniques with an AUC score of 0.9275.

AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are monitored and controlled by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems that use advanced computing, sensors, control systems, and communication networks. At first, CPS and SCADA systems were protected and secured by isolation. However, with recent industrial technology advances, the increased connectivity of CPSs and SCADA systems to enterprise networks has uncovered them to new cybersecurity threats and made them a primary target for cyber-attacks with the potential of causing catastrophic economic, social, and environmental damage. Recent research focuses on new methodologies for risk modeling and assessment using game theory and reinforcement learning.
   This paperwork proposes to frame CPS security on two different levels, strategic and battlefield, by meeting ideas from game theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The strategic level is modeled as imperfect information, extensive form game. Here, the human administrator and the malware author decide on the strategies of defense and attack, respectively. At the battlefield level, strategies are implemented by machine learning agents that derive optimal policies for run-time decisions. The outcomes of these policies manifest as the utility at a higher level, where we aim to reach a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in favor of the defender. We simulate the scenario of a virus spreading in the context of a CPS network. We present experiments using the MiniCPS simulator and the OpenAI Gym toolkit and discuss the results.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Industrial automation and control systems have gained increasing attention in the literature recently. Their integration with various systems has triggered considerable developments in critical infrastructure systems. With different network structures, these systems need to communicate with each other, work in an integrated manner, be controlled, and intervene effectively when necessary. Supervision Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are mostly utilized to achieve these aims. SCADA systems, which control and monitor the connected systems, have been the target of cyber attackers. These systems are subject to cyberattacks due to the openness to external networks, remote controllability, and SCADA-architecture-specific cyber vulnerabilities. Protecting SCADA systems on critical infrastructure systems against cyberattacks is an important issue that concerns governments in many aspects such as economics, politics, transport, communication, health, security, and reliability. In this study, we physically demonstrated a scaled-down version of a real water plant via a Testbed environment created including a SCADA system. In order to disrupt the functioning of the SCADA system in this environment, five attack scenarios were designed by performing various DDoS attacks, i.e., TCP, UDP, SYN, spoofing IP, and ICMP Flooding. Additionally, we evaluated a scenario with the baseline behavior of the SCADA system that contains no attack. During the implementation of the scenarios, the SCADA system network was monitored, and network data flow was collected and recorded. CNN models, LSTM models, hybrid deep learning models that amalgamate CNN and LSTM, and traditional machine learning models were applied to the obtained data. The test results of various DDoS attacks demonstrated that the hybrid model and the decision tree model are the most suitable for such environments, reaching the highest test accuracy of 95% and 99%, respectively. Moreover, we tested the hybrid model on a dataset that is used commonly in the literature which resulted in 98% accuracy. Thus, it is suggested that the security of the SCADA system can be effectively improved, and we demonstrated that the proposed models have a potential to work in harmony on real field systems.

AB New industrial control systems (ICSs) that have been modernized with the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are exposed to cyber-attacks that exploit IIoT vulnerabilities. Numerous intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have therefore been proposed to secure ICSs, many of which are based on machine learning, specifically deep neural networks (DNNs). Most of the proposed DNN-based solutions rely on single deep learning models and could be less costly in terms of ICS latency. However, they might have difficulties understanding the increasingly complex data distribution of intrusion patterns. Moreover, single deep learning models may not be effective in capturing the specific patterns of minority classes in highly imbalanced datasets, which is usually the case in cyber-security. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid multistage DNN-based intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) with better accuracy for critical ICSs that cannot afford to compromise on security to improve latency. The proposed approach sequentially learns the decision boundaries of the data that were misclassified or classified with low confidence by previous DNNs. Moreover, it incorporates a collaborative intrusion prevention system (IPS) with an emergency response schema that automatically mitigates attacks as soon as anomalies are detected. The results of experimental evaluations performed on different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

AB Critical infrastructures have recently been integrated with digital controls to support intelligent decision making. Although this integration provides various benefits and improvements, it also exposes the system to new cyberattacks. In particular, the injection of false data and commands into communication is one of the most common and fatal cyberattacks in critical infrastructures. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of machine-learning algorithms in detecting False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). In particular, we focus on two of the most widely used critical infrastructures, namely power systems and water treatment plants. This study focuses on tackling two key technical issues: (1) finding the set of best features under a different combination of techniques and (2) resolving the class imbalance problem using oversampling methods. We evaluate the performance of each algorithm in terms of time complexity and detection accuracy to meet the time-critical requirements of critical infrastructures. Moreover, we address the inherent skewed distribution problem and the data imbalance problem commonly found in many critical infrastructure datasets. Our results show that the considered minority oversampling techniques can improve the Area Under Curve (AUC) of GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and kNN by 10-12%.

AB In recent years, the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is a fastest advancing innovative technology with a potential to digitize and interconnect many industries for huge business opportunities and development of global GDP. IIoT is used in diverse range of industries such as manufacturing, logistics, transportation, oil and gas, mining and metals, energy utilities and aviation. Although IIoT provides promising opportunities for the development of different industrial applications, they are prone to cyberattacks and demands for higher security requirements. The enormous number of sensors present in the IIoT network generates a large amount of data and has attracted the attention of cybercriminals across globe. The intrusion detection system (IDS) that monitors the network traffic and detects the behaviour of the network is considered as one of the key security solution for securing IIoT application from attacks. Recently, the application of machine and deep learning techniques have proved to mitigate multiple security threats and enhance the performance of intrusion detection. In this paper, we present a survey of deep learning-based IDS technique for IIoT. The main objective of this research is to provide the various deep learning-based IDS detection methods, datasets and comwparative analysis. Finally, this research aims to identify the limitations and challenges of existing studies, solutions and future directions.

AB Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are cyber-physical systems that offer attractive targets to threat actors due to the scale of damages, both physical and cyber, that successful exploitation can cause. As such, ICSs often find themselves victims to reconnaissance campaigns - coordinated scanning activity that targets a wide subset of the Internet - that aim to discover vulnerable systems. As these campaigns likely scan broad netblocks of the Internet, some traffic is directed to network telescopes, which are routable, allocated, and unused IP space. In this paper, we explore the threat landscape of ICS devices by analyzing and investigating network telescope traffic. Our network traffic analysis tool takes darknet traffic and generates threat intelligence on scanning campaigns targeting ICSs in the form of campaign fragments, which we leverage in new ways to get more in-depth knowledge of the cybersecurity threats. We investigate the payloads of the identified campaigns using a custom Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technique to dissect and analyze the packets. We found 13 distinct payload templates and deduced their purpose, and by extension the campaign goals. We use machine learning to classify the sources behind the campaigns and identify threat actors such as botnets, malicious attackers, or researchers, and establish a methodology to rank our campaigns to prioritize our analysis. To conduct our analysis of the threats targeting ICSs, we have leveraged 12.85 TB (330 days) of network traffic received by our observed darknet IP space. Combining these investigative threads, we provide a thorough overview of the threat landscape targeting ICS systems.

Moreover, due to security and privacy issues, ICS owners usually do not share their network data with third parties to train specific machine learning-based ICS security solutions. To rectify the mentioned issues, a scalable deep federated learning-based method is presented in this paper. In the proposed method, each client trains an unsupervised deep neural network model using local data and shares its parameters with a server. The server aggregates the clients' parameters, makes a generalized public model, and shares it with all clients. The proposed model is evaluated using a real-world ICS dataset in a water treatment system and compared with two non-federated learning-based methods. Findings show that the proposed method outperformed the other two methods with the same computational complexity as other deep neural network-based methods in the literature.

AB The increasing adoption of the Industry 4.0 paradigm encompasses digitally interconnected factories which enables many advantages. However, it is still necessary to dedicate effort towards investigating protection mechanisms against cyberattacks in these scenarios. Despite the power demonstrated by Anomaly Detection-based Intrusion Detection Systems in industrial scenarios, their vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, especially to evasion attacks, make Machine Learning and Deep Learning models ineffective for real scenarios. These type of attacks craft samples misclassified by the Intrusion Detection System and potentially reach industrial devices, causing potentially damaging impacts to factory workers and industry resources. Adversarial attacks linked to industrial scenarios are currently in early stages of development, hence most of them have the capability to craft samples misclassified by the IDS but not reach industrial devices. In this work, we present a new adversarial attack named Selective and Iterative Gradient Sign Method that overcomes the limitation of the adversarial attacks present in the literature. To complement this work we also detail a study of how the detection rate of an Intrusion Detection System is degraded and the time required by each technique to generate adversarial samples. The experiments were carried out using a dataset named Electra, collected from an Electric Traction Substation, and showed that adversarial attacks evaluated crafted samples misclassified by the IDS. However, only the method we proposed generated samples that can be understood by intermediate network devices and, therefore, reach their destination. Our experiment outputs demonstrate a lower period of time to achieve and craft adversarial samples using out our iterative based process method as opposed to other current iterative methods currently available.

AB The landscape of cyber and other threats to Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), such as the Power Grid, is growing rapidly. Realistic and reconfigurable testbeds are needed to be able to develop, test, improve, and deploy practical cybersecurity solutions for CPS. We introduce the design of ISAAC, the Idaho CPS Smart Grid Cybersecurity Testbed. ISAAC is a cross-domain, distributed, and reconfigurable testbed, which emulates a realistic power utility and provides researchers with the tools needed to develop and test integrated cybersecurity solutions. Some components of ISAAC are fully functional, with ongoing research projects utilizing the functional components. When fully developed, the capabilities of ISAAC will include: 1) Multiple emulated power utility substations and control networks; 2) Emulating wide-area power transmission and distribution systems, 3) Emulated SCADA control centers, 4) Advanced visualization and cyber-analytics, including machine learning. ISAAC will enable the development, testing, evaluation, and validation of holistic cyber-physical security approaches for cyber physical systems and the Smart Grid. We hope that our endeavor, ISAAC, will help further the boundaries of CPS research and education.

AB Electric substation automation systems based on the IEC 61850 standard predominantly em-ploy the GOOSE and MMS protocols. Because GOOSE and MMS messages are not encrypted, an attacker can observe packet header information in protocol messages and inject large numbers of spoofed messages that can flood a substation automation system. Sophisticated machine-learning-based intrusion detection systems are required to detect these types of distributed denial-of-service attacks. However, the performance of machine-learning-based classifiers is hindered by the relative lack of features that express GOOSE and MMS protocol behavior.
   This paper evaluates a number of features described in the literature that may be used to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks on the GOOSE and MMS protocols. However, these features do not include advanced features that capture the periodic transmission behavior of SCADA protocols. Three SCADA-protocol-specific steps are specified for constructing new GOOSE and MMS advanced features by leveraging domain knowledge and adopting a time-window-based feature construction method. The resulting feature set, which comprises seventeen new GOOSE and MMS advanced features, outperforms the feature sets described in previous research when used with the popular decision tree, neural network and support vector machine classifiers. The evaluations also reveal that the decision tree classifier is superior to the neural network and support vector machine classifiers. A key contribution of this research is the application of SCADA-protocol-based domain knowledge to develop high-performance intrusion detection systems that require reduced training and testing times.

AB Technological developments and transformations have rapidly risen since the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The prevalence of industrial devices interconnected over the wireless sensor networks and the provision of a sustainable data flow reveal the importance of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In the manufacturing industry, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used to control IIoT for critical infrastructure. A cyberattack on the network-based communication structure embedded into the architecture of industrial equipment can significantly disrupt/sabotage product manufacturing and other industrial operations. The digitization of industrial control systems can expose the systems to malicious actors and therefore requires additional security solutions, such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, industrial companies need to adopt innovative solutions like artificial intelligence (AI)-based attack detection to protect their valuable assets. In addition, AI-based approaches are more effective as they analyze network traffic, identify threats, and adapt to new attack techniques. This study aims to develop an AI-based IDS with high accuracy for SCADA security. In the study, cyberattacks that may occur against SCADA systems are examined. AI methods (including K-nearest neighbor, quadratic discriminant analysis, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, and random forest) in different categories are used and AI models with various parameters are built. To improve the detection performance of the models, comprehensive experiments are carried out on two different SCADA data sets. As a result of experiments, the test accuracy rates exceeding 96.82% are achieved by all models: on the WUSTL-IIOT-2021 data set, the XGB model has outperformed with an accuracy of 99.99%.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) leverage the recent technological advancements in sensor technologies and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) for better processing, distribution, and delivery of clean water. Given the digital nature of CPSs, they can be vulnerable to different kinds of cyber threats, especially in cases where adversaries can conceal the state of the attack. If an adversary (state or non-state actor) successfully compromises a WDS, that could result in major destructive consequences to water quality, public health, and agricultural irrigation. This paper presents empirical Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods for detecting such concealed attacks in WDS. We present two Deep Learning (DL) models: Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) with Attention, a supervised learning model, and High Confidence Auto-Encoder (HCAE), an unsupervised learning model. TGCN adopts Attention and Robust Mahalanobis Distance (RMD) metrics for robust and generalizable forecasting performance. HCAE uses customized hidden layers to improve classification performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed models using the BATtle of the Attack Detection ALgorithms (BATADAL) dataset; founded on a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure. Additionally, we assess the performance of the two models against synthetically poisoned data generated from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Both attack detection models show superior accuracy with attack detection, localization, and overall robustness against data poisoning. The results suggest that both the supervised and unsupervised models perform better attack detection with a ranking score of 0.845 and 0.933, respectively. Results also indicate that, among the two models, the unsupervised model per-forms better in detecting poisoned data (accuracy: 0.992) and has better generalizability. Experimental results are recorded, evaluated, and discussed.

AB Constrained by the high acquisition and labeling cost, traffic data in industrial control systems (ICSs) are usually extremely imbalanced. Deep-learning-based (DL) industrial control intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are not applicable to dynamic networks and show a limited detection performance. In this article, we enhanced the information transmission link in adversarial domain adaptation (DA) and proposed an information-enhanced adversarial DA (IADA) method. Our method could train a cross-domain industrial intrusion detection deep model with imbalanced data and maintained high detection accuracy. The experimental results based on SCADA network layer data showed that the detection accuracy of the gated recurrent unit model trained in IADA reached 93.7% and 91.3% in the two transfer tasks with a significant cross-domain discrepancy.

AB Robust and adaptable cybersecurity mechanisms are needed to mitigate sophisticated and future zero-day cyberattacks and threats, particularly in the dynamic Fog of Things (FoT) computational paradigm, which makes use of massively distributed nodes. Deep learning (DL)-driven architectures have been proven more successful in big data areas than classical machine learning (ML) based algorithms. We orchestrate the software defined networking (SDN) control plane to propose a highly scalable proactive defense mechanism leveraging the Cuda-Deep Neural Network Gated Recurrent Unit (CU-DNNGRU) for the FoT critical computing infrastructure. Furthermore, the proposed framework does not place an extra burden on the underlying energy-and power -constrained FoT devices. We used the current state-of-the-art dataset (i.e., CICIDS2018) and evaluated our approach using standard performance metrics. We compare our proposed technique with our constructed hybrid DL-driven architectures and benchmark DL algorithms to evaluate its performance and efficacy. We hope that this work will enable further security research in the next -generation FoT computational paradigms.

AB The integration of the communications network and the Internet of Things in today's critical infrastructures facilitates intelligent and online monitoring of these systems. However, although critical infrastructure's digitalization brings tremendous advantages and opportunities for remote access and control, it significantly increases cyber-attack's vulnerability. Therefore, efficient and proper detection and localization of cyber-attack are paramount for the critical infrastructure's reliable and secure operation. This article proposes a deep learning-based cyber-attack detection and location identification system for critical infrastructures by constructing new representations and model the system behavior using multilayer autoencoders. The results show that the new representations capture the physical relationships among the measurements and have more discriminant power in distinguishing the location of the attack. Furthermore, the proposed method has outperformed conventional machine learning models under various cyber-attack scenarios using real-world data from the gas pipeline and water distribution supervisory control and data acquisition systems.

AB Smart grid data can be analyzed for detecting abnormalities in many different areas such as cybersecurity, fault detection, electricity theft, etc. There is a strong case for the use of machine learning in anomaly detection. The raw grid data requires feature extraction. Anomalies can be defined as instances or changes in the smart grid data that are out of character concerning the average trend. A typical grid architecture results can vary significantly, depending on trends or changes in power, voltage, current, or consumption. This paper develops an anomaly detection model for a real-world smart grid system implemented on a hardware-based testbed. By detecting abnormal activities, one can improve the system behavior in data communication flow. It will also identify if there are parameter changes that indicate the presence of cyber-attacks. Our proposed anomaly detection model is build based on Isolation Forest (IF) to isolate outliers from standard observations through multiple decision trees. The performance of the proposed detection method was verified using the simulation results on a hardware-based testbed. Feature selection was optimized by principal component analysis and the model was further analyzed for performance with dickey-fuller test.

AB Critical infrastructure, including refineries, pipelines and power grids are routinely monitored by supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The information exchange and communication aspects of such systems and their connected networks make them prone to cyberattacks. Providing SCADA systems with robust security and rapid cyber-attack detection is therefore imperative. Automatic intrusion detection can be provided by some machine learning methods, in particular, classification algorithms. However, such algorithms commonly disregard the difference between various misclassification errors. The techniques of cost-sensitive learning and Fisher's (linear) discriminant analysis (FDA) are separately investigated to overcome class imbalance issues in SCADA system datasets using five different machine learning algorithms applied to a well-studied gas pipeline dataset. The results reveal that the cost-sensitive learning is able to increase the performance of all the algorithms evaluated, especially their true positive rate. On the other hand, the FDA method can favorably influence only the HoeffdingTree and OneR algorithms. This suggests that the FDA method is not as powerful as the cost-sensitive learning in addressing class imbalance issues. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Machine learning has been widely studied in the security analysis of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). However, in industrial scenarios, the amount of data as well as the speed of data generation are very different from standard machine learning data sets. Using these heterogeneous data and finding meaningful insights for practical security applications in ICSs is a big challenge. In addition, ICSs have been built for quite a long time. Security has not been seriously taken into account when ICSs were built. Security assessment or attack prevention cannot always be done in real time, as an ICS requires to be online all the time, especially when it comes to systems that affect critical infrastructure. In this work, we are motivated to a provide a clear and comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art work that employs machine learning in security applications in ICSs, including vulnerability analysis, vulnerability detection and exploitation, anomaly detection and security assessment. Based on our in-depth survey, we highlight the issues of industrial protocol analysis with machine learning methods, provide the security applications with machine learning in ICSs and indicate the future directions.

AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) provide critical infrastructure for the betterment of human lives thereby integrating cyber and physical components but the fusion of physical and digital components leads to an increase in the attack surface, which in turn provides opportunities for the attackers to intrude on these systems, which can affect the critical services like health care, water treatment facility, the electrical grid, hydropower plant, and so forth. The existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) in CPSs are facing issues like poor detection accuracy, high false alarm rate and more computation time. Also, existing intrusion detection systems cannot identify new attacks that is, zero-day assaults. Prerequisite exists for the design of the framework for detecting intrusions using artificial intelligence inspired approaches grounded on the principle of ensemble techniques. Intrusion detection framework assimilating ensemble-based technique for CPS has been proposed. Since the proposed framework incorporates privileges of multiple techniques for intrusion detection and classification, hence the proposed framework may overcome the limitations of existing IDSs for CPS. Overview of cutting-edge incursion identification methods for CPSs is presented. Several characteristics of CPS, industrial protocols, and anomaly detection techniques for intrusion detection are analyzed. Taxonomy of IDS for CPS has been proposed, taxonomy of attacks and threats on CPS has been intended. Research challenges for IDS in CPS are also uncovered from this review.
   Review of various Industrial Protocols and identification of susceptibilities in them: Various industrial protocols that are used for communication in CPS are studied and analyzed then limitation of each of them is identified. Proposed taxonomy of IDS for CPS: Various IDS for CPS are studied and then they are categorized as different types grounded on the approach they deploy for identification of intrusion. Proposed taxonomy of CPS attacks: Various possible attacks on CPS are studied and then they are grouped into different types. Identification of research challenges in the existing literature: Various research challenges have been identified from this research which can help the researchers to work on fulfilling these gaps. image

   Adversarial sample attack; Adversarial sample defense
AB The challenge faced by industrial control systems is that they are vulnerable to adversarial sample attacks. In the ICS field, the challenge with adversarial sample attacks is that the adversarial samples generated by the attack do not conform to protocol specifications. The challenge of adversarial sample defense is that it is difficult to design a defense model without information about the adversarial samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adversarial sample attack and defense method based on Long Short -Term Memory Networks based Encoder -Decoder (LSTM-ED). The objectives are to address challenges of adversarial samples not conforming to protocol specifications and physical meaning, inefficient generation of adversarial samples, and the difficulty of designing a defense model without information about adversarial samples. Our adversarial sample attack efficiently generates samples conforming to protocol specifications and physical meaning by adding perturbation values to sensors and actuators, while complying with feature constraints. Subsequently, we introduce an LSTMED Feature Weight defense method (LSTM-FWED) designed without explicit adversarial sample information. In LSTM-FWED, we normalize reconstruction errors across different features to prevent anomaly scores from being influenced by poorly predicted features, thereby ensuring robust defense results. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a real -world critical infrastructure testbed. The proposed adversarial sample attack reduces the precision of the LSTM-ED model by an average of 66.26%, with a maximum adversarial sample generation time of 18 seconds, significantly improving attack efficiency. Furthermore, in comprehensive experiments, LSTMFWED demonstrates an average AUC improvement of 21.83% compared to state-of-the-art anomaly detection baseline methods.

AB Industry 4.0 is moving towards deployment using 5G as one of the main underlying communication infrastructures. Thus, the vision of the Industry of the future is getting more attention in research. Industry X (InX) is a significant thrust beyond the state-of-the-art of current Industry 4.0, towards a mix of cyber and physical systems through novel technological developments. In this survey, we define InX as the combination of Industry 4.0 and 5.0 paradigms. Most of the novel technologies, such as cyber-physical systems, industrial Internet of things, machine learning, advances in cloud computing, such as edge and fog computing, and blockchain, to name a few, are converged through advanced communication networks. Since communication networks are usually targeted for security attacks, these new technologies upon which InX relies must be secured to avoid security vulnerabilities propagating into InX and its components. Therefore, in this article, we break down the security concerns of the converged InX-communication networks into the core technologies that tie these, once considered distinct, fields together. The security challenges of each technology are highlighted and potential solutions are discussed. The existing vulnerabilities or research gaps are brought forth to stir further research in this direction. New emerging visions in the context of InX are provided towards the end of the article to provoke further curiosity of researchers.

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a crucial role in overseeing and controlling renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal resources. Nevertheless, with the expansion of conventional SCADA network infrastructures, there arise significant challenges in managing and scaling due to increased size, complexity, and device diversity. Using Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology in traditional SCADA network infrastructure offers management, scaling and flexibility benefits. However, as the integration of SDN-based SCADA systems with modern technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and big data analytics increases, cybersecurity becomes a major concern for these systems. Therefore, cyber-physical energy systems (CPES) should be considered together with all energy systems. One of the most dangerous types of cyber-attacks against SDN-based SCADA systems is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks disrupt the management of energy resources, causing service interruptions and increasing operational costs. Therefore, the first step to protect against DDoS attacks in SDN-based SCADA systems is to develop an effective intrusion detection system. This paper proposes a Decision Tree-based Ensemble Learning technique to detect DDoS attacks in SDN-based SCADA systems by accurately distinguishing between normal and DDoS attack traffic. For training and testing the ensemble learning models, normal and DDoS attack traffic data are obtained over a specific simulated experimental network topology. Techniques based on feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are used to optimize the performance of the decision tree ensemble models. Experimental results show that feature selection, combination of different decision tree ensemble models, and hyperparameter tuning can lead to a more accurate machine learning model with better performance detecting DDoS attacks against SDN-based SCADA systems.

AB Cyber-Physical Systems are becoming more susceptible to cyber intrusion, compromising the critical infrastructure of the smart grid. This emerging concern requires the urgent help of researchers to find a practical and better approach to secure an intelligent power grid against cyber-attack. This research article proposes a "Statistical Machine Learning Defensive Mechanism (SML-DM)" for Smart Grid Cyber-Physical Networks (SGCPN) against cyber intrusion by using a Gaussian mixture model merged with wireless sensor data. Using SML-DM, two new indices are proposed to evaluate the performance of the defensive mechanism. The first index, Data Prediction Error (DPE), calculates actual and predicted data errors during a cyber-attack. The second index, Sensor Reliability Score (SRS), is used to assess the reliability status of wireless sensors. MATLAB software was used to validate this research, and data was taken from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Using the proposed defence mechanism, it is found that the data integrity and reliability of the sensors can increase by up to 90%. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, OT (operational technology) networks of industrial control systems have been combined with IT networks. Therefore, OT networks have inherited the vulnerabilities and attack paths existing in IT networks. Consequently, attacks on industrial control systems are increasing, and research on technologies combined with artificial intelligence for detecting attacks is active. Current research focuses on detecting attacks and improving the detection accuracy. Few studies exist on metrics that interpret anomaly detection results. Different analysis metrics are required depending on the characteristics of the industrial control system data used for anomaly detection and the type of attack they contain. We focused on the fact that industrial control system data are time series data. The accuracy and F1-score are used as metrics for interpreting anomaly detection results. However, these metrics are not suitable for evaluating anomaly detection in time series data. Because it is not possible to accurately determine the start and end of an attack, range-based performance metrics must be used. Therefore, in this study, when evaluating anomaly detection performed on time series data, we propose a range-based performance metric with an improved algorithm. The previously studied range-based performance metric time-series aware precision and recall (TaPR) evaluated all attacks equally. In this study, improved performance metrics were studied by deriving ambiguous instances according to the characteristics of each attack and redefining the algorithm of the TaPR metric. This study provides accurate assessments when performing anomaly detection on time series data and allows predictions to be evaluated based on the characteristics of the attack.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in critical infrastructure face serious threats of attack, motivating research into a wide variety of defence mechanisms such as those that monitor for violations of invariants, i.e. logical properties over sensor and actuator states that should always be true. Many approaches for identifying invariants attempt to do so automatically, typically using data logs, but these can miss valid system properties if relevant behaviours are not well-represented in the data. Furthermore, as the CPS is already built, resolving any design flaws or weak points identified through this process is costly. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants from an analysis of a CPS design, based on principles of the axiomatic design methodology from design science. Our method iteratively decomposes a high-level CPS design to identify sets of dependent design parameters (i.e. sensors and actuators), allowing for invariants and invariant checkers to be derived in parallel to the implementation of the system. We apply our method to the designs of two CPS testbeds, SWaT and WADI, deriving a suite of invariant checkers that are able to detect a variety of single- and multi-stage attacks without any false positives. Finally, we reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of our approach, how it can be complemented by other defence mechanisms, and how it could help engineers to identify and resolve weak points in a design before the controllers of a CPS are implemented.

AB Radar systems are used to detect the existence, location, and trajectory of objects in space using electromagnetic waves. They are mainly used for tracking aircraft, missiles, satellites, and watercraft. In recent years, as technology has evolved, the use of radar systems has increased, along with reliance on their correct and reliable operation. Given this, the reliability and availability of information provided by radar systems is growing in importance. Although the field of cyber security has been continuously evolving, most studies conducted on protecting radar systems have focused on electronic warfare. Radar systems also include a wide variety of components, such as a communications system or SCADA system, which are also vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this study, we present a risk analysis for radar systems. First, we present an in depth review of the existing literature on related topics. Then, we describe the threats we identified and their possible outcome. Finally, we demonstrate the realization of an attack on a radar system created for this task. We conclude by identifying future research directions aiming at protecting advanced radar systems from cyber attacks.

AB The emerging smart grid, cyber-physical infrastructure, provides a steady, secure, and reliable power system over the current power grid. Synchrophasor systems, like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), are a key element of smart grids. They have the capability to measure time-coherent phasors of a grid. The key advantage of PMUs is the fast sampling rate that they provide over traditional Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems which can be in the range of 30-120 samples/second. These higher sampling rates come at the cost of higher data quantities. Generating large amounts of data per day poses a challenge in making the most efficient use of information. In this paper, this problem has been addressed utilizing machine learning techniques, Logistic Regression Analysis, on PMU data. Identifying system anomalies in smart power grids is the primary focus of this paper. The standard IEEE 39 Bus system has been modified using the RT-LAB environment to generate faults and to produce synthetic synchrophasor data. Archived/offline mode data from a Phasor data concentrator (PDC) database is being used to train and test the algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm has been tested in real-time using an OPAL-RT digital real-time simulator.

AB Despite the increasing awareness of cyber-attacks against Critical Infrastructure (CI), safeguarding the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems remains inadequate. For this purpose, designing an efficient SCADA Intrusion Detection System (IDS) becomes a significant research topic of the researchers to counter cyber-attacks. Most of the existing works present several statistical and machine learning approaches to prevent the SCADA network from the cyber-attacks. Whereas, these approaches failed to concern the most common challenge, "Curse of dimensionality". This scenario accentuates the necessity of an efficient feature selection algorithm in SCADA IDS where it identifies the relevant features and eliminates the redundant features without any loss of information. Hence, this paper proposes a novel filter-based feature selection approach for the identification of informative features based on Rough Set Theory and Hyper-clique based Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (RST-HCBWoA). Experiments were carried out by Power system attack dataset and the performance of RST-HCBWoA was evaluated in terms of reduct size, precision, recall, classification accuracy, and time complexity.

DE neural networks; adversarial machine learning; intrusion detection
AB Machine learning systems have had enormous success in a wide range of fields from computer vision, natural language processing, and anomaly detection. However, such systems are vulnerable to attackers who can cause deliberate misclassification by introducing small perturbations. With machine learning systems being proposed for cyber attack detection such attackers are cause for serious concern. Despite this the vast majority of adversarial machine learning security research is focused on the image domain. This work gives a brief overview of adversarial machine learning and machine learning used in cyber attack detection and suggests key differences between the traditional image domain of adversarial machine learning and the cyber domain. Finally we show an adversarial machine learning attack on an industrial control system.

AB With the growing integration of IoT devices in critical infrastructure, cybersecurity threats such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Energy Hubs (EH) have become a significant concern. This study aims to address these challenges by evaluating the effectiveness of various supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms in predicting DDoS attacks targeting EH systems through IoT devices. Using the CICDDOS2019 and KDD-CUP datasets, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on several classifiers, including Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The results highlight Gradient Boosting as the most effective model, particularly for the CICDDOS2019 dataset, demonstrating superior accuracy and predictive capability. Additionally, hybrid models combining Gradient Boosting with SVM or DT showed strong performance, though with varying precision and recall. This study provides valuable insights into the selection and tailoring of ML models for specific security challenges, emphasizing the need for ongoing research to enhance the resilience of EH systems and IoT devices against evolving DDoS threats.

These revolutionary decentralization, decarbonization, and digitalization techniques have ushered in a new global energy paradigm. Waves of disruption have been felt across the electricity industry as the digitalization journey in this sector has converged with advances in artificial intelligence (AI). However, there are risks involved. As AI becomes more established, new security threats have emerged. Among the most important is the cyber-physical protection of critical infrastructure, such as the power grid. This article focuses on dueling AI algorithms designed to investigate the trustworthiness of power systems' cyber-physical security under various scenarios using the phasor measurement units (PMU) use case. Particularly in PMU operations, the focus is on areas that manage sensitive data vital to power system operators' activities. The initial stage deals with anomaly detection applied to energy systems and PMUs, while the subsequent stage examines adversarial attacks targeting AI models. At this stage, evaluations of the Madry attack, basic iterative method (BIM), momentum iterative method (MIM), and projected gradient descend (PGD) are carried out, which are all powerful adversarial techniques that may compromise anomaly detection methods. The final stage addresses mitigation methods for AI-based cyberattacks. All these three stages represent various uses of AI and constitute the dueling AI algorithm convention that is conceptualised and demonstrated in this work. According to the findings of this study, it is essential to investigate the trade-off between the accuracy of AI-based anomaly detection models and their digital immutability against potential cyberphysical attacks in terms of trustworthiness for the critical infrastructure under consideration.

AB In recent years, federated learning has been applied to the security of the Internet of Things and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) due to its advantages in communication cost and privacy preserving. However, the existing deep learning models used in federated learning -based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are manually designed by relying on the extensive experiences of designers and are not applicable in different scenarios flexibly. In this paper, we make the first attempt to automatically design a lightweight federated learning model termed as Fed -GA -CNN -IDS for the IDS issue in ICS by evolutionary neural architecture search (NAS). Five lightweight neural architectures of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are considered as the basic blocks to be combined and optimized in federated NAS for ICS intrusion detection. An efficient discrete encoding strategy is developed to describe the combination of five basic lightweight blocks and the specific discrete evolutionary operations under the framework of genetic algorithm (GA) are designed elaborately to guide the evolutionary process of an automated federated learning model. The experimental results on three widely -used intrusion detection datasets in ICSs such as Gas Pipeline, SWaT and WADI, demonstrate that the proposed Fed -GA -CNN -IDS method can obtain more lightweight models and better or at least competitive intrusion detection performance than three state-of-the-art manually -designed federated learning -based IDS methods, two federated NAS methods originally developed for traditional image classification tasks, and four lightweight IDS methods.

TI A TabPFN-based intrusion detection system for the industrial internet of

AB The industrial internet of things (IIoT) has undergone rapid growth in recent years, which has resulted in an increase in the number of threats targeting both IIoT devices and their connecting technologies. However, deploying tools to counter these threats involves tackling inherent limitations, such as limited processing power, memory, and network bandwidth. As a result, traditional solutions, such as the ones used for desktop computers or servers, cannot be applied directly in the IIoT, and the development of new technologies is essential to overcome this issue. One approach that has shown potential for this new paradigm is the implementation of intrusion detection system (IDS) that rely on machine learning (ML) techniques. These IDSs can be deployed in the industrial control system or even at the edge layer of the IIoT topology. However, one of their drawbacks is that, depending on the factory's specifications, it can be quite challenging to locate sufficient traffic data to train these models. In order to address this problem, this study introduces a novel IDS based on the TabPFN model, which can operate on small datasets of IIoT traffic and protocols, as not in general much traffic is generated in this environment. To assess its efficacy, it is compared against other ML algorithms, such as random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, by evaluating each method with different training set sizes and varying numbers of classes to classify. Overall, TabPFN produced the most promising outcomes, with a 10-20% differentiation in each metric. The best performance was observed when working with 1000 training set samples, obtaining an F1 score of 81% for 6-class classification and 72% for 10-class classification.

AB Technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have converged in driving the next wave of digital revolution. Amalgamating the aforementioned advancements with critical infrastructure (CI) can significantly help society by offering a quality of life and boosting the nation's economy and productivity. However, the lack of cybersecurity in CI gave rise to advanced threats and vulnerabilities that hindered the aforementioned societal benefits. In this vein, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of cyber threats and risks associated with different critical infrastructures, such as the financial, agriculture, energy, and healthcare sectors. Further, we thoroughly investigate the staggering benefits of AI and, based on it, present an exhaustive solution taxonomy to showcase the competency of AI mechanisms in confronting cyberattacks on CI. The taxonomy specifically addresses issues like data privacy, algorithmic bias, and human -AI collaboration for CI. Further, we proposed an AI-based secure data exchange framework for smart grid CI, where we attempt to secure the sensor's data (i.e., power consumption, energy readings, and network data) from malicious adversaries. The proposed framework is evaluated using statistical measures, such as accuracy, training time, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and anomaly detection. Further, the paper examines the research challenges that still adhere to the critical systems and require stringent AI-based mechanisms to tackle them.

AB In industrial control systems (ICSs), intrusion detection is a vital task. Conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) rely on manually designed rules. These rules heavily depend on professional experience, thereby making it challenging to represent the increasingly complicated industrial control logic. Although deep learning-based approaches provide better accuracy than other methods, they can only provide alerts. However, they cannot provide administrators with detailed information. In this study, we propose the logic understanding IDS (LU-IDS), which is a rule-based IDS with in-depth understandings of industrial control logic. Our proposed LU-IDS uses a specially designed deep learning-based model to capture features automatically and carry out attack classification. More importantly, it analyzes the knowledge learned from the classification of attacks to understand the abnormal industrial control logic and generate rules. The experimental results indicate that our proposed LU-IDS demonstrates excellent performance on intrusion detection. The rules generated by our proposed LU-IDS can be used to successfully detect all types of attacks on two public datasets.

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are widely used for remote monitoring and control of industrial processes, such as oil and gas production, power generation, transmission and distribution, and water treatment. Despite the enhanced accessibility, control, and data availability afforded by recent advances in communication technologies, the utilization of these technologies exposes critical infrastructures such as power systems to potential cyber threats. A Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) seems promising; however, the development of ML models often requires custom methodologies for data preprocessing and training. This strategic approach is necessary for creating high-performance models that can be robustly evaluated and seamlessly integrated into real-time systems. As a result, we propose an ML-based IDS design framework for a SCADA-based power system incorporating effective modeling aspects, such as dataset preprocessing to ensure accurate representation, data augmentation for achieving a balanced dataset, automated feature selection to reduce dimensionality, and rigorous model training and testing procedures. To substantiate our proposed design framework, we conducted a series of experiments using a publicly available ORNL (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) dataset for a SCADA-based power system. The evaluation process encompasses efficient validation techniques with unseen data. Furthermore, the augmented dataset emerged through the aggregation of readings from four Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) collected over a specific time span into a unified dataset. Among the assessed classifiers, the Random Forest (RF) model, trained on an augmented and balanced dataset, outperformed others, yielding an F1 score of 94.09% during testing with unseen data.

AB A cyber physical system (CPS) is a network of cyber (computation, communication) and physical (sensors, actuators) components which interact with one another in a feedback form with human intervention. CPS authorizes the critical infrastructure and is treated as essential in day to day life as they exist in the basis of future smart devices. The increased exploitation of the CPS results in various threats and becomes a global problem. Therefore, it becomes essential to develop a safe, efficient, and robust CPS for real tine environment. For resolving this problem and accomplish security in CPS environment, intrusion detection system (IDS) can be developed. This study introduces an imbalanced generative adversarial network (IGAN) with optimal kernel extreme learning machine (OKELM), called IGAN-OKELM technique for intrusion detection in CPS environment. The proposed IGAN-OKELM technique mainly aims to address the class imbalance problem and intrusion detection. Besides, the IGAN-OKELM technique involves the IGAN model handling the class imbalance problem by the use of imbalanced data filter and convolution layers to the conventional generative adversarial network (GAN), which generates new instances for minority class labels. Moreover, the OKELM model is applied as a classifier and the optimal parameter tuning of the KELM model is performed by the use of sand piper optimization (SPO) algorithm and thereby improvises the intrusion detection performance. A wide ranging simulation analysis is carried out using benchmark dataset and the results are examined under varying aspects. The experimental results reported the better performance of the IGAN-OKELM technique over the recent state of art approaches interms of different measures.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are multi-layer complex systems that form the basis for the world's critical infrastructure and, thus, have a significant impact on human lives. In recent years, the increasing demand for connectivity in CPS has brought attention to the issue of cyber security. Aside from traditional information systems threats, CPS faces new challenges due to the heterogeneity of devices and protocols. In this paper, we assess how feature selection may improve different machine learning training approaches for intrusion detection and identify the best features for each intrusion detection system (IDS) setup. In particular, we propose using F1-Score as a criteria for the adapted greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) metaheuristic to improve the intrusion detection performance through binary, multi-class, and expert classifiers. Our numerical results reveal that there are different feature subsets that are more suitable for each combination of IDS approach, classifier algorithm, and attack class. The GRASP metaheuristic found features that detect accurately four DoS (denial of service) attack classes and several variations of injection attacks in cyber physical systems.

AB ABSTARCT The industry 4.0 has created a paradigm shift in how industrial equipment could be monitored and diagnosed with the help of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). AI-driven troubleshooting tools play an important role in high-efficacy diagnosis and monitoring processes, especially for systems consisting of several components including wind turbines (WTs). The utilization of such approaches not only reduces the troubleshooting and diagnosis time but also enables fault prevention by predicting the behavior of different components and calculating the probability of near future failure. This not only decreases the costs of repair by providing constant component's monitoring and identifying faults' causes but also increases the efficacy of the apparatus by lowering the downtimes due to the AI-driven early warning system. This article evaluated, compared, and contrasted eight different artificial neural network (ANN) models for diagnosis and monitoring of WTs that predict the machinery's system failure based on internal components' sensor signals and generation temperature. This article employed a machine learning model approach with two hidden layers using multilayer linear regression to achieve its objective. The developed system predicted the output of the WT's generator temperature with an accuracy of 99.8% with 2 months in advance measurement prediction.

AB Industry 4.0 refers to a new generation of connected and intelligent factories that is driven by the emergence of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, Cloud computing, Big Data and industrial control systems (ICS) in order to automate all phases of industrial operations. The presence of connected systems in industrial environments poses a considerable security challenge, moreover with the huge amount of data generated daily, there are complex attacks that occur in seconds and target production lines and their integrity. But, until now, factories do not have all the necessary tools to protect themselves, they mainly use traditional protection. To improve industrial control systems in terms of efficiency and response time, the present paper propose a new distributed intrusion detection approach using artificial intelligence methods including machine learning, Big Data techniques and deployed in a cloud environment. We use the industrial dataset SWat for the experiment. Our system achieved good results in terms of Accuracy (99%) and response time by using Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBTs) classifier due to the performance of Databricks and Apache Spark.

AB Training effective simulation scenarios presents numerous challenges from a pedagogical point of view. Through application of the Conceptual Framework for e-Learning and Training (COFELET) as a pattern for designing serious games, we propose the use of the Simulated Critical Infrastructure Protection Scenarios (SCIPS) platform as a prospective tool for supporting the process of providing effective cyber security training. The SCIPS platform is designed to run different scenarios, such as examples in financial forecasting and business infrastructures, with an initial scenario developed in collaboration with industrial partners focusing on an electricity generation plant. Focus groups from these sources were conducted to identify design and developmental considerations for the platform. As an extension from the COFELET framework, we propose an intelligence scaffolding practice as a guidance mechanic taking the form of an agent within the scenario. The agent represents a major innovation in the system and we envisage a deep learning-based augmentation to further adapt towards the behavioural aspects of learners. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Critical infrastructures which are crucial to our modern life such as electricity grids and water pumps are controlled by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Over the last two decades connecting these critical infrastructures to the internet has become essential. This made SCADA security an increasingly important research topic. This paper copes with two challenges: (1) SCADA systems tend to repeat themselves within a well-defined time period; then a malicious attacker can change the duration time in which the system holds a certain value without changing the order of the activities, i.e., the order in which the values appear. (2) The malicious activity may affect the data payload of the communicated SCADA packets rather than the explicit defined function codes (W/R). To face these challenges we propose two machine learning algorithms. The first algorithm is supervised. It finds first frequent temporal patterns, then these patterns are recognized in the data payload of the SCADA communication protocols, and used as features for a classification algorithm. The second algorithm is unsupervised. It learns an automaton that represents the temporal behavior of the system. Then at runtime, unknown states or events are declared as malicious. Experimental evaluation on real MODUBS-SCADA dataset from Ben-Gurion University shows that the first supervised algorithm, that uses frequent temporal patterns as features, performs better than a baseline algorithm that considers the mean and standard deviation as features. The second unsupervised algorithm performs even better than the first one. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Machine learning techniques are gaining attention in the context of intrusion detection due to the increasing amounts of data generated by monitoring tools, as well as the sophistication displayed by attackers in hiding their activity. However, existing methods often exhibit important limitations in terms of the quantity and relevance of the generated alerts. Recently, knowledge graphs are finding application in the cybersecurity domain, showing the potential to alleviate some of these drawbacks thanks to their ability to seamlessly integrate data from multiple domains using human-understandable vocabularies. We discuss the application of machine learning on knowledge graphs for intrusion detection and experimentally evaluate a link-prediction method for scoring anomalous activity in industrial systems. After initial unsupervised training, the proposed method is shown to produce intuitively well-calibrated and interpretable alerts in a diverse range of scenarios, hinting at the potential benefits of relational machine learning on knowledge graphs for intrusion detection purposes.

   layer-wise relevance propagation
AB Intrusion detection is only the initial part of the security system for an industrial control system. Because of the criticality of the industrial control system, professionals still make the most important security decisions. Therefore, a simple intrusion alarm has a very limited role in the security system, and intrusion detection models based on deep learning struggle to provide more information because of the lack of explanation. This limits the application of deep learning methods to industrial control network intrusion detection. We analyzed the deep neural network (DNN) model and the interpretable classification model from the perspective of information, and clarified the correlation between the calculation process of the DNN model and the classification process. By comparing the normal samples with the abnormal samples, the abnormalities that occur during the calculation of the DNN model compared to the normal samples could be found. Based on this, a layer-wise relevance propagation method was designed to map the abnormalities in the calculation process to the abnormalities of attributes. At the same time, considering that the data set may already contain some useful information, we designed filtering rules for a kind of data set that can be obtained at a low cost, so that the calculation result is presented in a more accurate manner, which should help professionals lock and address intrusion threats more quickly.

DE Intrusion Detection; OS Diversity; SCADA; Machine Learning
AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been a frequent target of cyberattacks in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). As such systems are a frequent target of highly motivated attackers, researchers often resort to intrusion detection through machine learning techniques to detect new kinds of threats. However, current research initiatives, in general, pursue higher detection accuracies, neglecting the detection of new kind of threats and their proposal detection scope. This paper proposes a novel, reliable host-based intrusion detection for SCADA systems through the Operating System (OS) diversity. Our proposal evaluates, at the OS level, the SCADA communication over time and, opportunistically, detects, and chooses the most appropriate OS to be used in intrusion detection for reliability purposes. Experiments, performed through a variety of SCADA OSs front-end, shows that OS diversity provides higher intrusion detection scope, improving detection accuracy by up to 8 new attack categories. Besides, our proposal can opportunistically detect the most reliable OS that should be used for the current environment behavior, improving by up to 8%, on average, the system accuracy when compared to a single OS approach, in the best case.

AB Due to the rise of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) cyber-attacks in the recent decade, various security frameworks have been designed for anomaly detection. While advanced ICS attacks use sequential phases to launch their final attacks, existing anomaly detection methods can only monitor a single source of data. However, analysis of multiple security data could provide more comprehensive and system-wide anomaly detection in industrial networks. In this paper, we present an anomaly detection framework for ICSs that consists of two stages: i) blockchain-based log management where the logs of ICS devices are collected in a secure and distributed manner, and ii) multi-source anomaly detection where the blockchain logs are analysed using multi-source deep learning which in turn provides a system wide anomaly detection method. We validated our framework using two ICS datasets: a factory automation dataset and a Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset. These datasets contain physical and network level normal and abnormal traffic. The performance of our new framework is compared with single-source machine learning methods. The precision of our framework is 95% which is comparable with single-source anomaly detectors. However, multi-source analysis is more robust because it can detect anomalies from multiple sources simultaneously, while achieving comparable precision for each of the sources.

TI Machine Learning Based Error Detection in Transient Susceptibility Tests

DE Anomaly detection (AD); electromagnetic compatibility (EMC); machine
   learning; transient susceptibility
AB Compliance to electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards is a fundamental requirement for modern integrated circuits (ICs). In this framework, error detection in transient susceptibility tests is of crucial importance to assess the circuit robustness. However, performing such tests is expensive and requires an ad hoc hardware, whose configuration must be adapted for the different test setups, i.e., the transient waveforms, defined in the EMC standards. This paper describes a novel machine learning based approach for error detection, which only requires the raw output data from a susceptibility test: neither additional information about the architecture of the device under test nor the test configuration is needed. We applied and evaluated anomaly detection techniques (a branch of machine learning methods focused on error detection) for transient susceptibility tests with two pertinent examples (one simulation- and one measurement-based). The proposed techniques detected errors successfully in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios. Moreover, these can give insight on the output behaviors that are more likely to cause errors during the test. As shown by our results, an anomaly detection-based approach is an applicable and viable solution for automatic error detection in transient susceptibility tests.

AB This paper presents a control strategy for Cyber-Physical System defense developed in the framework of the European Project ATENA, that concerns Critical Infrastructure (CI) protection. The aim of the controller is to find the optimal security configuration, in terms of countermeasures to implement, in order to address the system vulnerabilities. The attack/defense problem is modeled as a multi-agent general sum game, where the aim of the defender is to prevent the most damage possible by finding an optimal trade-off between prevention actions and their costs. The problem is solved utilizing Reinforcement Learning and simulation results provide a proof of the proposed concept, showing how the defender of the protected CI is able to minimize the damage caused by his/her opponents by finding the Nash equilibrium of the game in the zero-sum variant, and, in a more general scenario, by driving the attacker in the position where the damage she/he can cause to the infrastructure is lower than the cost it has to sustain to enforce her/his attack strategy.

AB Vulnerability of water infrastructure to cyber-attacks is proliferated as the operation of these systems is automated using networked systems. Reports of several cyber-attacks to water systems such as the 2006 Pennsylvania Water Company hack and the 2012 Tijuana River sewage spill has proven the water community concerns for the security of these systems. This study proposes a machine-learning-based anomaly detection methodology for early cyber-attack detection and warning that is tailored to water distributions systems security. Attacks are assumed to be manifested as man-induced anomalies in SCADA time series data that should be detected in a short time with low false negative/positive rates. The methodology is trained by and examined on the BATtle of the Attack Detection ALgorithms (BATADAL) dataset.

AB The significance of anomaly detection is paramount for ensuring the security and better cost-efficiency of smart grids. The extensive installation of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) brings convenience to consumers as well as utility providers by enabling real-time monitoring and management of energy consumption. However, dependence on communication technology also increases vulnerability to false data injection (FDI) or malicious attacks. In this paper, a model of machine learning known as an extreme gradient boosting classifier is explored by incorporating SCADA system for detection of anomalies in energy consumption patterns. Further, statistical tools such as principal component analysis and interquartile range are used for the preprocessing of the raw data. In this presented work, multi-class problem including six different types of synthetically developed attacks by considering statistical features are also examined. To validate the proposed framework, the IEEE 33 bus test system and the IRISH data set have been taken into consideration. Comparative analysis has been done with existing models using several evaluation matrices, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Results show that after integration of power system data, the accuracy of the proposed model is significantly improved.

AB Due to cyber threats, Process Control Systems (PCS) are increasingly at risk in the interconnected world. This review elucidates PCS's mounting cybersecurity challenges, underscored by past incidents. Utilizing the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework, we emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, spanning risk identification to its mitigation. This systematic framework comprises five pillars: risk identification, protective measures, active threat detection, timely incident response, and postattack recovery. This study then delves into the range of cyber-attack detection algorithms, from traditional fault detection and isolation techniques to advanced machine learning-based methods, qualitative models, hybrid approaches, and signature-based methods. Notwithstanding the progress, research gaps, challenges, and a demand for a proactive path forward remain. This study proposes a path forward that integrates the digital system with a resilient control system to ensure the security of the process control systems and a harmonious blend of domain expertise and evolving technological innovations.

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which play a critical role in monitoring, managing, and controlling industrial processes, face flexibility, scalability, and management difficulties arising from traditional network structures. Software-defined networking (SDN) offers a new opportunity to overcome the challenges traditional SCADA networks face, based on the concept of separating the control and data plane. Although integrating the SDN architecture into SCADA systems offers many advantages, it cannot address security concerns against cyber-attacks such as a distributed denial of service (DDoS). The fact that SDN has centralized management and programmability features causes attackers to carry out attacks that specifically target the SDN controller and data plane. If DDoS attacks against the SDN-based SCADA network are not detected and precautions are not taken, they can cause chaos and have terrible consequences. By detecting a possible DDoS attack at an early stage, security measures that can reduce the impact of the attack can be taken immediately, and the likelihood of being a direct victim of the attack decreases. This study proposes a multi-stage learning model using a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and decision tree-based classification to detect DDoS attacks in SDN-based SCADA systems effectively. A new dataset containing various attack scenarios on a specific experimental network topology was created to be used in the training and testing phases of this model. According to the experimental results of this study, the proposed model achieved a 97.8% accuracy rate in DDoS-attack detection. The proposed multi-stage learning model shows that high-performance results can be achieved in detecting DDoS attacks against SDN-based SCADA systems.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is the most abundant technology in the fields of manufacturing, automation, transportation, robotics, and agriculture, utilizing the IoT's sensors-sensing capability. It plays a vital role in digital transformation and smart revolutions in critical infrastructure environments. However, handling heterogeneous data from different IoT devices is challenging from the perspective of security and privacy issues. The attacker targets the sensor communication between two IoT devices to jeopardize the regular operations of IoT-based critical infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain-driven secure data dissemination architecture to deal with critical infrastructure security and privacy issues. First, we reduced dimensionality using principal component analysis (PCA) and explainable AI (XAI) approaches. Furthermore, we applied different AI classifiers such as random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), perceptron, and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) that classify the data, i.e., malicious or non-malicious. Furthermore, we employ an interplanetary file system (IPFS)-driven blockchain network that offers security to the non-malicious data. In addition, to strengthen the security of AI classifiers, we analyze data poisoning attacks on the dataset that manipulate sensitive data and mislead the classifier, resulting in inaccurate results from the classifiers. To overcome this issue, we provide an anomaly detection approach that identifies malicious instances and removes the poisoned data from the dataset. The proposed architecture is evaluated using performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). The findings show that the RF classifier transcends other AI classifiers in terms of accuracy, i.e., 98.46%.

AB Blockchain is a significant advancement in technology recently, transforming the traditional centralized system into a decentralized one. Smart contracts, as one of the best applications of blockchain, show great potential in various fields, such as finance, supply chain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). As the world's first blockchain platform to support turing complete smart contracts, Ethereum has become the most critical infrastructure for the digital world. However, with the vigorous development of smart contracts, malicious attacks against smart contracts have frequently occurred in recent years. The issue of smart contract security has attracted widespread attention due to the huge financial losses caused by smart contract vulnerabilities. Although researchers have made some progress in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities through symbolic execution and fuzzing-based methods, existing methods mainly rely on expert knowledge and hand-crafted features, leading to many detection errors. Even worse, existing methods take tens of seconds or even minutes to detect each smart contract on average, which is extremely time-consuming. In this work, we present SVScanner, the new method combining two features of heterogeneous patterns to detect smart contract vulnerabilities in the blockchain. Specifically, we first extract global semantic features from the sequence of contract code tokens. Then we further use the attention mechanism to capture deep structural semantics from the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of smart contracts. Finally, we combine these two features from different patterns and use a text convolutional neural network (TextCNN) to detect contract bugs. Experimental results show that SVScanner has the ability to detect vulnerabilities effectively in real-world smart contract datasets. SVScanner achieves a 7.33% improvement in accuracy compared with other traditional methods. Moreover, our method requires significantly less detection time.

AB Smart grids are complex cyber-physical systems that incorporate smart devices' communication capabilities into the grid to enable remote management and the control of power systems. However, this integration reveals numerous SCADA system flaws, which could compromise security goals and pose severe cyber threats to the smart grid. In conventional works, various attack detection methodologies are developed to strengthen the security of smart grid SCADA systems. However, they have several issues with complexity, slow training speed, time consumption, and inaccurate prediction outcomes. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel security framework for protecting smart grid SCADA systems against harmful network vulnerabilities or intrusions. Therefore, the proposed work is motivated to develop an intelligent meta-heuristic-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) mechanism for securing IoT-SCADA systems. The proposed framework includes the stages of dataset normalization, Zaire Ebola Search Optimization (ZESO), and Deep Random Kernel Forest Classification (DRKFC). First, the original benchmarking datasets are normalized based on content characterization and category transformation during preprocessing. After that, the ZESO algorithm is deployed to select the most relevant features for increasing the training speed and accuracy of attack detection. Moreover, the DRKFC technique accurately categorizes the normal and attacking data flows based on the optimized feature set. During the evaluation, the performance of the proposed ZESO-DRKFC method is validated and compared in terms of accuracy, detection rate, f1-score, and false acceptance rate. According to the results, it is observed that the ZESO-DRKFC mechanism outperforms other techniques with high accuracy (99%) by precisely spotting intrusions in the smart grid systems.

AB In this paper, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method based on the Autoencoder with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM-Autoencoder) network and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies in industrial control system (ICS) using cyber-physical fusion features. This method improves the recall of anomaly detection and overcomes the challenges of unbalanced datasets and insufficient labeled samples in ICS. As a first step, additional network features are extracted and fused with physical features to create a cyber-physical dataset. Following this, the model is trained using normal data to ensure that it can properly reconstruct the normal data. In the testing phase, samples with unknown labels are used as inputs to the model. The model will output an anomaly score for each sample, and whether a sample is anomalous depends on whether the anomaly score exceeds the threshold. Whether using supervised or unsupervised algorithms, experimentation has shown that (1) cyber-physical fusion features can significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection algorithms; (2) the proposed method outperforms several other unsupervised anomaly detection methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score; (3) the proposed method can detect the majority of anomalous events with a low false negative rate.

AB Anomaly detection problems in industrial control systems (ICSs) are always tackled by a network traffic monitoring scheme. However, traffic-based anomaly detection systems may be deceived by anomalous behaviors that mimic normal system activities and fail to achieve effective anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel solution to this problem based on measurement data. The proposed method combines a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) and uses particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is called PSO-1DCNN-BiLSTM. It enables the system to detect any abnormal activity in the system, even if the attacker tries to conceal it in the system's control layer. A supervised deep learning model was generated to classify normal and abnormal activities in an ICS to evaluate the method's performance. This model was trained and validated against the open-source simulated power system dataset from Mississippi State University. In the proposed approach, we applied several deep-learning models to the dataset, which showed remarkable performance in detecting the dataset's anomalies, especially stealthy attacks. The results show that PSO-1DCNN-BiLSTM performed better than other classifier algorithms in detecting anomalies based on measured data.

AB Recently, neural networks (NNs) have been proposed for the detection of cyber attacks targeting indus-trial control systems (ICSs). Such detectors are often retrained, using data collected during system oper-ation, to cope with the evolution of the monitored signals over time. However, by exploiting this mech-anism, an attacker can fake the signals provided by corrupted sensors at training time and poison the learning process of the detector to allow cyber attacks to stay undetected at test time. Previous work ex-plored the ability to generate adversarial samples that fool anomaly detection models in ICSs but without compromising their training process. With this research, we are the first to demonstrate such poisoning attacks on ICS cyber attack online detectors based on neural networks. We propose two distinct attack al-gorithms, namely, interpolation-and back-gradient-based poisoning, and demonstrate their effectiveness. The evaluation is conducted on diverse data sources: synthetic data, real-world ICS testbed data, and a simulation of the Tennessee Eastman process. This first practical evaluation of poisoning attacks using a simulation tool highlights the challenges of poisoning dynamically controlled systems. The generality of the proposed methods under different NN parameters and architectures is studied. Lastly, we propose and analyze some potential mitigation strategies.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in public infrastructure, such as water treatment and distribution plants, have become a target of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Given the ever-present insider and other threats in such systems, there is a need to deploy mechanisms for defense and incidence response beyond the traditional. In this work we present AICrit that operates over the physical constraints and domain norms for accurate and timely detection of process anomalies. AICrit learns system-wide normal behavior using design knowledge and machine learning algorithms to recognize abnormal or irregular behavioral patterns resulting due to process anomalies. AICrit was implemented and evaluated in SWaT by launching several real-time stealthy and coordinated attacks. Experimental results attest to the effectiveness of AICrit in the timely detection of process anomalies with a low occurrence of false alarms. The underlying methodology used in the design of AICrit is generic and applicable to other ICS in various domains such as power, energy, and transportation.

AB Industrial Process Control Systems (IPCS) like Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Detection of malicious traffic in IPCS-SCADA network using machine learning techniques is one of the security enhancement methods of Industrial Process Control Systems. The existing network intrusion detection methods used limited old data sets and little addressed for IPCS-SCADA specific network. In this paper we evaluated machine learning algorithms with and with out filtering and sampling techniques for intrusion detection in IPCS-SCADA network. In this work, we generated own data set with network traffic contains both normal and attack data using a real time SCADA test bed. Next we applied feature extraction techniques Chi-Square, ANOVA and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to reduce the feature set dimensionality. We applied SVM variant Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SVMSMOTE) for handling this imbalance data set. After that we used four Machine Learning (ML) algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB) and calculated various performance metrics like Accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), recall, F1-score, FNR and ROC. We evaluated the performance of these ML algorithms with (a) ML techniques only (b) ML techniques with feature selection methods (c) ML techniques with SVMSMOTE only (d) ML techniques with both feature selection methods and SVMSMOTE. We concluded from the results that SVM algorithm with filtering and SVMSMOTE technique outperforms compared to other three machine learning algorithms, with ROC value of 99.96%.

AB The inclusion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is growing rapidly in all application domains. Smart Farming uses IoT devices to increase efficiency and optimize farming operations. These devices can be used in a cloud or edge computing infrastructure which can provide remote control of watering and fertilization, real time monitoring of farm conditions, and provide solutions for more sustainable practices. These improvements to efficiency and ease of use come with added risks to security and privacy. Combining vulnerable IoT devices with the critical infrastructure of the agriculture domain broadens the attack surface for adversaries. Cyberattacks in a large coordinated manner could disrupt the economy of agriculture-dependent nations. To the sensors in a system, an attack may appear as anomalous behaviour. Additionally, there are possibilities of anomalies generated due to faulty hardware, issues in network connectivity (if present), or simply abrupt changes to the environment due to weather, human error, or other unforeseen circumstances. To make these systems more secure, it is imperative to detect such data discrepancies and trigger appropriate mitigation mechanisms. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection model for Smart Farming using an unsupervised Autoencoder machine learning model. We chose to use an Autoencoder as our method of anomaly detection because it attempts to reconstruct normal data with a low reconstruction loss and anomalous data with a high loss. The high reconstruction loss value for a data point indicates that the data is not like the rest. Our model was trained and tested on data collected from our greenhouse test-bed. Our proposed Autoencoder based anomaly detection method achieved 98.98% and took 262 seconds to train and has a detection time of .0585 seconds.

AB Hardware cybersecurity has become a key issue, especially for very large integrated circuits. If counterfeit, forged, or defective ICs present a significant threat to system reliability and security. The growing complexity of digital and mixed-signal systems makes it increasingly challenging yet vital to develop robust methods to assess and confirm the reliability and authenticity of ICs. We introduce a new terahertz testing method for non-destructive and unobtrusive identification of counterfeit, damaged, forged or defective ICs by measuring their response to incident terahertz and sub-terahertz radiation at the circuit pins and analyzing the response using artificial intelligence (AI). These responses create unique signatures for ICs. We generated 2D images by measuring the response on a selected pin of a radio frequency IC (RFIC) scanned by a focused terahertz radiation. By applying the data augmentation processes, we created a secure image data set to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. An unsecured image data set representing altered or damaged ICs was generated by modifying the original image data. The trained models identified secure devices with a similar to 94% accuracy.

TI FALCON: Framework for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems

DE industrial controls systems; attack detection; neural networks
AB Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are used to control physical processes in critical infrastructure. These systems are used in a wide variety of operations such as water treatment, power generation and distribution, and manufacturing. While the safety and security of these systems are of serious concern, recent reports have shown an increase in targeted attacks aimed at manipulating physical processes to cause catastrophic consequences. This trend emphasizes the need for algorithms and tools that provide resilient and smart attack detection mechanisms to protect ICS. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework for ICS based on a deep neural network. The proposed methodology uses dilated convolution and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to learn temporal as well as long term dependencies within sensor and actuator data in an ICS. The sensor/actuator data are passed through a unique feature engineering pipeline where wavelet transformation is applied to the sensor signals to extract features that are fed into the model. Additionally, this paper explores four variations of supervised deep learning models, as well as an unsupervised support vector machine (SVM) model for this problem. The proposed framework is validated on Secure Water Treatment testbed results. This framework detects more attacks in a shorter period of time than previously published methods.

AB The implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in medical environments, has introduced a growing list of security vulnerabilities and threats. The lack of an extensible big data resource that captures medical device vulnerabilities limits the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based cyber defense systems in capturing, detecting, and preventing known and future attacks. We describe a system that generates a repository of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) about various medical devices and their known vulnerabilities from sources such as manufacturer and ICS-CERT vulnerability alerts. We augment the intelligence repository with data sources such as Wikidata and public medical databases. The combined resources are integrated with threat intelligence in our Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph (CKG) from previous research. The augmented graph embeddings are useful in querying relevant information and can help in various AI assisted cybersecurity tasks. Given the integration of multiple resources, we found the augmented CKG produced higher quality graph representations. The augmented CKG produced a 31% increase in the Mean Average Precision (MAP) value, computed over an information retrieval task.

AB Progress in modern biology is being driven, in part, by the large amounts of freely available data in public resources such as the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), the world's primary database of biological sequence (and related) information. INSDC and similar databases have dramatically increased the pace of fundamental biological discovery and enabled a host of innovative therapeutic, diagnostic, and forensic applications. However, as high-value, openly shared resources with a high degree of assumed trust, these repositories share compelling similarities to the early days of the Internet. Consequently, as public biological databases continue to increase in size and importance, we expect that they will face the same threats as undefended cyberspace. There is a unique opportunity, before a significant breach and loss of trust occurs, to ensure they evolve with quality and security as a design philosophy rather than costly "retrofitted" mitigations. This Perspective surveys some potential quality assurance and security weaknesses in existing open genomic and proteomic repositories, describes methods to mitigate the likelihood of both intentional and unintentional errors, and offers recommendations for risk mitigation based on lessons learned from cybersecurity.

AB The paper examines various aspects of the machine learning methods applicability for intrusion detection in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) using Gas Pipeline data set as an example. Several reasons which make it difficult to use classical classification, clustering, and anomaly detection algorithms to identify anomalies of industrial processes were formulated as a result of analyzing number of papers. It's proposed to use recurrent neural networks to model and predict the network traffic of the ICS for the anomaly detection. It was shown that by predicting the network traffic of the ICS, the anomalies caused by a network attack can be identified. The results of experiments of two recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM and GRU) usage for intrusion detection on the Gas Pipeline data set are presented. The capabilities of the considered recurrent neural network architectures were demonstrated in the intrusion detection problem of ICS. An optimal architecture of recurrent neural networks was determined depending on the specified security level and used computing resources.

ID DEEP LEARNING APPROACH; ANOMALY DETECTION
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is integral to modern infrastructure, enabling connectivity among a wide range of devices from home automation to industrial control systems. With the exponential increase in data generated by these interconnected devices, robust anomaly detection mechanisms are essential. Anomaly detection in this dynamic environment necessitates methods that can accurately distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior by learning intricate patterns. This paper presents a novel approach utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) for anomaly detection in IoT systems. However, optimizing GANs involves tuning hyper-parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and optimization algorithms, which can be challenging due to the non-convex nature of GAN loss functions. To address this, we propose a five-dimensional Gray wolf optimizer (5DGWO) to optimize GAN hyper-parameters. The 5DGWO introduces two new types of wolves: gamma (gamma) for improved exploitation and convergence, and theta (theta) for enhanced exploration and escaping local minima. The proposed system framework comprises four key stages: 1) preprocessing, 2) generative model training, 3) autoencoder (AE) training, and 4) predictive model training. The generative models are utilized to assist the AE training, and the final predictive models (including convolutional neural network (CNN), deep belief network (DBN), recurrent neural network (RNN), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) are trained using the generated data and AE-encoded features. We evaluated the system on three benchmark datasets: NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and IoT-23. Experiments conducted on diverse IoT datasets show that our method outperforms existing anomaly detection strategies and significantly reduces false positives. The 5DGWO-GAN-CNNAE exhibits superior performance in various metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, root mean square error (RMSE), and convergence trend. The proposed 5DGWO-GAN-CNNAE achieved the lowest RMSE values across the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and IoT-23 datasets, with values of 0.24, 1.10, and 0.09, respectively. Additionally, it attained the highest accuracy, ranging from 94% to 100%. These results suggest a promising direction for future IoT security frameworks, offering a scalable and efficient solution to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) contains many devices that can compute and communicate, creating large networks. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) represents a developed application of IoT, connecting with embedded technologies in production in industrial operational settings to offer sophisticated automation and real-time decisions. Still, IIoT compels significant cybersecurity threats beyond jamming and spoofing, which could ruin the critical infrastructure. Developing a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS) addresses the challenges and vulnerabilities present in these systems. Traditional IDS methods have achieved high detection accuracy but need improved scalability and privacy issues from large datasets. This paper proposes a Fog-enabled Federated Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (FFL-IDS) utilizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that mitigates these limitations. This framework allows multiple parties in IIoT networks to train deep learning models with data privacy preserved and low-latency detection ensured using fog computing. The proposed FFL-IDS is validated on two datasets, namely the Edge-IIoTset, explicitly tailored to environments with IIoT, and CIC-IDS2017, comprising various network scenarios. On the Edge-IIoTset dataset, it achieved 93.4% accuracy, 91.6% recall, 88% precision, 87% F1 score, and 87% specificity for jamming and spoofing attacks. The system showed better robustness on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, achieving 95.8% accuracy, 94.9% precision, 94% recall, 93% F1 score, and 93% specificity. These results establish the proposed framework as a scalable, privacy-preserving, high-performance solution for securing IIoT networks against sophisticated cyber threats across diverse environments.

AB Security is a complex issue in critical infrastructure like industrial control systems (ICS) since its leakages cause critical damage. Protecting the ICS environment from external threats, cyber-attacks, and natural disasters is important. Various works have been done on anomaly detection in ICS, and it has been identified that these proposed approaches are the sole models associated with them. Although there is a research gap in anomaly detection methodologies because of their computational complexity. To overcome the research gap of high false positive rate (precision), accuracy, and computational complexity in the literature, the study presents an Improved autoencoder (ImpAE) anomaly detection methodology for anomaly detection in ICS. The proposed methodology is a deep learning-based model to build anomaly detectors that alarm the attacks affecting ICS security. This methodology follows a flexible and modular design that permits a group of numerous detectors to get suitable detection. To express the suitability of the proposed model, we implemented it on the Secure water testbed (SWat) dataset, which is collected from a working water treatment plant. Experimental work shows that by using ImpAE, gaining a precision of 0.993 and an accuracy of 96%, in comparision to the existing results in the literature. With precision and accuracy, we gained a recall of 0.673 and an F1-Score of 0.771, which is better than the average of the other works. The used dataset was attained from ITrust Center, Singapore University of Digital Science, reliable for anomaly detection in an ICS environment.

AB As a critical infrastructure for contemporary information technology industry, industrial internet of things (IIoT) contains a vast amount of sensitive data, making it a key requirement to ensure data security. As the use of wireless networks as a means of communication between nodes is becoming more and more common, in order to prevent malicious attacks from compromising the system, a zero-trust authentication system is necessary. In this article, we propose a comprehensive implementation framework for zero-trust verification of IIoT wireless transmission nodes, which utilizes federated learning to achieve zero-trust rule training and terminal model training, while employing blockchain technology for on-chain aggregation and cloud backup of the models. This approach enhances the accuracy and availability of the zero-trust rules while safeguarding the security of IIoT nodes. The constructed zero-trust framework incorporates a self-incremental learning function, and experiments show that it achieves a high level of accuracy at recognising attacks. Finally, we discuss the challenges of utilizing federated learning in zero-trust for IIoT and several potential solutions to address these challenges.

AB Neural Networks are one of the most popular methods nowadays given their high performance on diverse tasks, such as computer vision, anomaly detection, computer-aided disease detection and diagnosis or natural language processing. While neural networks are known for their high performance, they often suffer from the so-called "black-box" problem, which means that it is difficult to understand how the model makes decisions. We introduce a neural network topology based on Generalized Additive Models. By training an independent neural network to estimate the contribution of each feature to the output variable, we obtain a highly accurate and explainable deep learning model, providing a flexible framework for training Generalized Additive Neural Networks which does not impose any restriction on the neural network architecture. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through different simulation studies with synthetic datasets, as well as a real-world use case of Distributed Denial of Service cyberattack detection on an Industrial Control System. The results show that our proposal outperforms other GAM-based neural network implementations while providing higher interpretability, making it a promising approach for high-risk AI applications where transparency and accountability are crucial.

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are crucial for modern industrial processes and securing them against increasing cyber threats is a significant challenge. This study presents an advanced method for bolstering SCADA security by employing a modified hybrid deep learning model. A key innovation in this work is integrating the Self-similarity Hurst parameter into the dataset alongside a CNN-LSTM model, significantly boosting the Intrusion Detection System's (IDS) capabilities. The Hurst parameter, which quantifies the self-similarity in a dataset, is instrumental in detecting anomalies. Our in-depth analysis of the CICIDS2017 dataset sheds light on contemporary attack patterns and network traffic behaviors. The CNN-LSTM architecture was substantially altered by adding multiple convolutional layers with progressively increasing filters, batch normalization for stable training, and dropout layers for regularization. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for dimensionality reduction, thereby optimizing the dataset. Test results demonstrate the superior performance of the model incorporating the Hurst parameter, achieving 95.21% accuracy and 82.59% recall, significantly surpassing the standard model. The inclusion of the Hurst parameter marks a substantial advancement in identifying emerging threats, while architectural improvements to the CNN-LSTM model led to more robust and accurate intrusion detection in industrial control settings.

AB Deep learning (DL) can provide critical infrastructure operators with valuable insights and predictive capabilities to help them make more informed decisions, improving system's robustness. However, training DL models requires large amounts of data, which can be costly to store in a centralized manner. Storing large amounts of sensitive critical infrastructure data in the cloud can pose significant security risks. Federated learning (FL) allows several clients to share learning data and train ML models. Unlike centralized models, FL does not require the sharing of client data. A novel framework is presented to train a VGG16 based CNN global model without sharing the data and only updating the local models among clients using federated averaging. For experimentation, MNIST dataset is used. The framework achieves high accuracy and keep data private using FL in critical infrastructures. The benefits and challenges of FL along with security vulnerabilities and attacks have been discussed along with the defenses that can be used to mitigate these attacks.

AB Distribution transformers are an integral part of the power distribution system network and emerging smart grids. With the increasing dynamic service requirements of consumers, there is a higher likelihood of transformer failures due to overloading, feeder line faults, and ineffective cooling. As a consequence, their general longevity has been diminished, and the maintenance efforts of utility providers prove inadequate in efficiently monitoring and detecting transformer conditions. Existing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) metering points are sparsely allocated in the network, making fault detection in feeder lines limited. To address these issues, this work proposes an IoT system for real-time distribution transformer load monitoring and anomaly detection. The monitoring system consists of a low-cost IoT gateway and sensor module which collects a three-phase load current profile, and oil levels/temperature from a distributed transformer network, specifically at the feeder side. The data are communicated through the publish/subscribe paradigm to a cloud IoT pipeline and stored in a cloud database after processing. An anomaly detection algorithm in the form of Isolation Forest is implemented to intelligently detect likely faults within a time window of 24 h prior. A mobile application was implemented to interact with the cloud database, visualize the real-time conditions of the transformers, and track them geographically. The proposed work can therefore reduce transformer maintenance costs with real-time monitoring and facilitate predictive fault analysis.

ID ATTACK DETECTION
AB Critical infrastructures across many industries, such as smart water treatment and distribution networks (SWTDNs) and power generation and public transport networks, depend on the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. However, being the core component of the critical infrastructures, it has made the SCADA-based SWTDN system an attractive target for cyberattacks. A successful attack on the SCADA will have a devastating impact on an SWTDN in terms of proper operations; therefore, safeguarding the SCADA from cyberattacks is of paramount. With the increasing cyberattacks on SWTDN, both in number and sophistication, the need to detect these attacks early has become a subject of great interest among practitioners and researchers. To this end, we propose a novel strategy, based on a semisupervised approach. Two semisupervised approaches, including unsupervised learning and deep learning-based approaches, have been proposed. The proposed approaches can involve learning dynamic cyberattack patterns from unlabeled data in an SWTDN. We validate the proposed semisupervised approach experimentally using an operational water treatment plant testbed. The proposed approach achieved almost 100% accuracy and substantially outperforms the existing baseline approaches used in this article. The outcome of the experiment is encouraging and demonstrates the potential use of the semisupervised approach for security control in smart water distribution.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION; SCADA SYSTEM
AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play an important role in Smart Grid. Though the rapid evolution provides numerous advantages it is one of the most desired targets for malicious attackers. So far security measures deployed for SCADA systems detect cyber-attacks, however, the performance metrics are not up to the mark. In this paper, we have deployed an intrusion detection system to detect cyber-physical attacks in the SCADA system concatenating the Convolutional Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Unit as a collective approach. Extensive experiments are conducted using a benchmark dataset to validate the performance of the proposed intrusion detection model in a smart metering environment. Parameters such as accuracy, precision, and false-positive rate are compared with existing deep learning models. The proposed concatenated approach attains 98.84% detection accuracy which is much better than existing techniques.

AB In this paper, a novel unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithm is presented for the expeditious RF fingerprinting of LoRa modulated chirps. Identification based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) alone is unlikely to yield a robust means for sensor authentication within critical infrastructure deployment. Here, an unsupervised ML algorithm is used to rapidly train an artificial neural network (ANN) matrix creating self-organizing maps (SOMs) for each authentic transmitter and a potential rogue node. A general classifier can be trained on the SOMs for precisely profiling each transmitter as either genuine or rogue. By means of experimental validation, this methodology demonstrated cent-percent success in recognizing each transmitter, either being a real or a rogue node.

AB This article presents three-tiered intrusion detection systems, which uses a supervised approach to detect cyber-attacks in industrial control systems networks. The proposed approach does not only aim to identify malicious packets on the network but also attempts to identify the general and finer grain attack type occurring on the network. This is key in the industrial control systems environment as the ability to identify exact attack types will lead to an increased response rate to the incident and the defence of the infrastructure. More specifically, the proposed system consists of three stages that aim to classify: (i) whether packets are malicious; (ii) the general attack type of malicious packets (e.g. Denial of Service); and (iii) finer-grained cyber-attacks (e.g. bad cyclic redundancy check, attack). The effectiveness of the proposed intrusion detection systems is evaluated on network data collected from a real industrial gas pipeline system. In addition, an insight is provided as to which features are most relevant in detecting such malicious behaviour. The performance of the system results in an F-measure of: (i) 87.4%, (ii) 74.5% and (iii) 41.2%, for each of the layers, respectively. This demonstrates that the proposed architecture can successfully distinguish whether network activity is malicious and detect which general attack was deployed.

AB Over the past decade, industrial control systems have experienced a massive integration with information technologies. Industrial networks have undergone numerous technical transformations to protect operational and production processes, leading today to a new industrial revolution. Information Technology tools are not able to guarantee confidentiality, integrity and availability in the industrial domain, therefore it is of paramount importance to understand the interaction of the physical components with the networks. For this reason, usually, the industrial control systems are an example of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This paper aims to provide a tool for the detection of cyber attacks in cyber-physical systems. This method is based on Machine Learning to increase the security of the system. Through the analysis of the values assumed by Machine Learning it is possible to evaluate the classification performance of the three models. The model obtained using the training set, allows to classify a sample of anomalous behavior and a sample that is related to normal behavior. The attack identification is implemented in water tank system, and the identification approach using Machine Learning aims to avoid dangerous states, such as the overflow of a tank. The results are promising, demonstrating its effectiveness.

AB The security of smart grid is a major challenge in grid modernization. While many existing solutions rely on human-defined features to develop machine learning (ML) based attack detectors against prominent exploits, such features are becoming more expensive and less effective in the smart grid. To supplement more high-quality features for ML-based threat monitoring, this paper proposed a stacked autoencoder (SAE) based deep learning framework to develop machine-learned features against transmission SCADA attacks. Compared with the state-of-the-art ML detectors, the proposed framework leverages the automaticity of unsupervised feature learning to reduce the reliance on system models and human expertise in complex security scenarios. Simulations with data collected from a highfidelity smart grid testbed demonstrated that the machine-learned features effectively enabled more accurate discrimination against SCADA exploits in power transmission systems.

AB Nowadays, the industrial systems are more and more interconnected with the outside world. However, the interconnection of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems with the outside world using Internet-based standards introduce numerous vulnerabilities to these systems. Although awareness is constantly rising, the SCADA systems are still exposed to serious threats. In this paper, a review of Intrusion Detection and report results is conducted in the surveyed works. In the end, we also discuss the potential research directions on this topic.

AB Due to human errors, noise during transmission and other interference, some data collected from industrial process system might be lost in the collection process, which would affect the whole quality of data. In addition, the data collected by the industrial control system are generally composited of a large number of high-dimensional data. To facilitate the follow-up processing like anomaly detection, the "the curse of dimensionality" need to be solved, to obtain useful and meaningful content from massive high-dimensional data. The features obtained from DBNs (Deep Belief Networks) are usually not on the low-dimensional surface, and they can well express high-dimensional nonlinear function with a variety of variables. Therefore, in this paper, the DBNs are used to solve the data processing problem in industrial control system. Moreover, some experiments have been done to reveal that the DBNs algorithm can improve the filling accuracy, and the reduction of dimensions of data is good for effective information extraction.

AB Significant advancement in deep learning (DL) has turned it into an integral part of robust approaches for addressing cybersecurity problems in both current and aging infrastructures. Control flow graphs (CFGs) have demonstrated their effectiveness as leading choices that result in high-performing classifiers among various data representations used by DL-based models. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have made breakthroughs in the graph domain, and before long, they were jointly used with CFGs to train performant malware classifiers. However, graph-based adversarial attacks have caused suspicion about the predictions these graph-based malware classifiers make, and few studies have investigated detecting such attacks. Therefore, this article proposes a novel GNN-based adversarial detector for identifying adversarial CFGs with higher efficacy than the previous work. This adversarial detector is placed in a data pipeline before a GNN-based malware classifier. In this article, we solve the adversarial detection problem as an anomaly detection scenario and train the adversarial detector to learn the normal data distribution. Our GNN-based adversarial detector detects 98.96% of all adversarial CFGs, which is 1.17% higher than the previous method, with a 5.95% lower false positive rate (FPR). In the most hazardous category of the attack, where the attacker intends to render a malicious example as a benign input, we achieve a 4.85% boost compared to the previous competitors.

AB The domain name system (DNS) has evolved into an essential component of network communications, as well as a critical component of critical industrial systems (CIS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network connection. DNS over HTTPS (DoH) encapsulating DNS within hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) does not eliminate network access exploitation. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning model for the early classification of encoded network traffic into one of the two classes: DoH and NonDoH. They can be malicious, benign, or zero-day attacks. The proposed scheme incorporates the swiftness of the convolutional neural network (CNN) in extracting useful information and the ease of long short-term memory (LSTM) in learning long-term dependencies. The simulation results showed that the proposed approach accurately classifies the encoded network traffic as DoH or NonDoH and characterizes the traffic as benign, zero-day, or malicious. The proposed robust hybrid deep learning model had high accuracy and precision of 99.28%, recall of 99.75%, and AUC of 0.9975 at a minimal training and testing time of 745s and 0.000324 s, respectively. In addition to outperforming other compared contemporary algorithms and existing techniques, the proposed technique significantly detects all attack types. This study also investigated the impact of the SMOTE technique as a tool for data balancing. To further validate the reliability of the proposed scheme, an industrial control system SCADA (ICS-SCADA) dataset, in addition to two (2) other cyber-security datasets (NSL-KDD and CICDS2017), were evaluated. Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) was employed to validate the model performance, confirming the applicability of the proposed model in a critical industrial system such as SCADA.

TI Global-local integration for GNN-based anomalous device state detection

AB Anomaly detection are gaining popularity among the research communities for its essential role in securing Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Over the decades, diverse approaches have been proposed to profile anomalous behaviours propagating across the ICS networks. Recent attempts using the Graph Neural Network (GNN) methodologies have enabled state prediction of a device node via encoding its immediate neighbourhood. Such an encoding scheme potentially compromises the model's detection accuracy due to the nodes' biased attention towards their local surroundings. To investigate this issue, we present the Global-Local Integration Network (GLIN) that achieves node-level anomaly detection by merging a node's local and the network's global ex-pressions. It comprises a preprocessor for graph construction and data transformation, an encoder for node embedding learning, a pooling module producing global representations, an integration module that performs message fusion, and a decoder for label prediction. We develop and evaluate GLIN with 7 global integration schemes and train it over 3 message passing mechanisms. We compare its performance against both classical machine learning and recent deep learning baselines and demonstrate its superiority in terms of multiple popular metrics. Finally, we provide useful insights on the results and suggest promising future work directions.

AB Communication networks in power systems are a major part of the smart grid paradigm. It enables and facilitates the automation of power grid operation as well as self-healing in contingencies. Such dependencies on communication networks, though, create a roam for cyber-threats. An adversary can launch an attack on the communication network, which in turn reflects on power grid operation. Attacks could be in the form of false data injection into system measurements, flooding the communication channels with unnecessary data, or intercepting messages. Using machine learning-based processing on data gathered from communication networks and the power grid is a promising solution for detecting cyber threats. In this paper, a co-simulation of cyber-security for cross-layer strategy is presented. The advantage of such a framework is the augmentation of valuable data that enhances the detection as well as identification of anomalies in the operation of the power grid. The framework is implemented on the IEEE 118-bus system. The system is constructed in Mininet to simulate a communication network and obtain data for analysis. A distributed three controller software-defined networking (SDN) framework is proposed that utilizes the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) cluster. According to the findings of our suggested architecture, it outperforms a single SDN controller framework by a factor of more than ten times the throughput. This provides for a higher flow of data throughout the network while decreasing congestion caused by a single controller's processing restrictions. Furthermore, our CECD-AS approach outperforms state-of-the-art physics and machine learning-based techniques in terms of attack classification. The performance of the framework is investigated under various types of communication attacks.

AB The integration of communication networks and the internet of industrial control in Industrial Control System (ICS) increases their vulnerability to cyber attacks, causing devastating outcomes. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) largely rely on predefined models and are trained mostly on specific cyber attacks, which means the traditional IDS cannot cope with unknown attacks. Additionally, most IDS do not consider the imbalanced nature of ICS datasets, thus suffering from low accuracy and high False Positive Rates when being put to use. In this paper, we propose the NCO-double-layer DIFF_RF-OPFYTHON intrusion detection method for ICS, which consists of NCO modules, double-layer DIFF_RF modules, and OPFYTHON modules. Detected traffic will be divided into three categories by the double-layer DIFF_RF module: known attacks, unknown attacks, and normal traffic. Then, the known attacks will be classified into specific attacks by the OPFYTHON module according to the feature of attack traffic. Finally, we use the NCO module to improve the model input and enhance the accuracy of the model. The results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional intrusion detection methods, such as XGboost and SVM. The detection of unknown attacks is also considerable. The accuracy of the dataset used in this paper reaches 98.13%. The detection rates for unknown attacks and known attacks reach 98.21% and 95.1%, respectively. Moreover, the method we proposed has achieved suitable results on other public datasets.

AB Apache Log4j2 is a prevalent logging library for Java-based applications. In December 2021, several critical and high-impact software vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-44228, were publicly disclosed, enabling remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS) attacks. To date, these vulnerabilities are considered critical and the consequences of their disclosure far-reaching. The vulnerabilities potentially affect a wide range of internet of things (IoT) devices, embedded devices, critical infrastructure (CI), and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In this paper, we study the effects and feasibility of exploiting these vulnerabilities in mission-critical aviation and maritime environments using the ACARS, ADS-B, and AIS protocols. We develop a systematic methodology and an experimental setup to study and identify the protocols' exploitable fields and associated attack payload features. For our experiments, we employ software-defined radios (SDRs), use open-source software, develop novel tools, and develop features to existing software. We evaluate the feasibility of the attacks and demonstrate end-to-end RCE with all three studied protocols. We demonstrate that the aviation and maritime environments are susceptible to the exploitation of the Log4j2 vulnerabilities, and that the attacks are feasible for non-sophisticated attackers. To facilitate further studies related to Log4j2 attacks on aerospace, aviation, and maritime infrastructures, we release relevant artifacts (e.g., software, documentation, and scripts) as open-source, complemented by patches for bugs in open-source software used in this study.

AB Anomaly-based intrusion detection promises to detect novel or unknown attacks on industrial control systems by modeling expected system behavior and raising corresponding alarms for any deviations. As manually creating these behavioral models is tedious and error-prone, research focuses on machine learning to train them automatically, achieving detection rates upwards of 99 %. However, these approaches are typically trained not only on benign traffic but also on attacks and then evaluated against the same type of attack used for training. Hence, their actual, real-world performance on unknown (not trained on) attacks remains unclear. In turn, the reported near-perfect detection rates of machine learning-based intrusion detection might create a false sense of security. To assess this situation and clarify the real potential of machine learning-based industrial intrusion detection, we develop an evaluation methodology and examine multiple approaches from literature for their performance on unknown attacks (excluded from training). Our results highlight an ineffectiveness in detecting unknown attacks, with detection rates dropping to between 3.2 % and 14.7 % for some types of attacks. Moving forward, we derive recommendations for further research on machine learning-based approaches to ensure clarity on their ability to detect unknown attacks.

AB Due to the drastic increase in the number of critical infrastructures like nuclear plants, industrial control systems (ICS), transportation, it becomes highly vulnerable to several attacks. They become the major targets of cyberattacks due to the increase in number of interconnections with other networks. Several research works have focused on the design of intrusion detection systems (IDS) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. At the same time, Blockchain (BC) technology can be applied to improve the security level. In order to resolve the security issues that exist in the critical infrastructures and ICS, this study designs a novel BC with deep learning empowered cyber-attack detection (BDLE-CAD) in critical infrastructures and ICS. The proposed BDLE-CAD technique aims to identify the existence of intrusions in the network. In addition, the presented enhanced chimp optimization based feature selection (ECOA-FS) technique is applied for the selection of optimal subset of features. Moreover, the optimal deep neural network (DNN) with search and rescue (SAR) optimizer is applied for the detection and classification of intrusions. Furthermore, a BC enabled integrity checking scheme (BEICS) has been presented to defend against the misrouting attacks. The experimental result analysis of the BDLE-CAD technique takes place and the results are inspected under varying aspects. The simulation analysis pointed out the supremacy of the BDLE-CAD technique over the recent state of art techniques with the accuy of 92.63%.

AB The railway transport system is critical infrastructure that is exposed to numerous man-made and natural threats, thus protecting this physical asset is imperative. Cyber security, privacy, and dependability (SPD) are also important, as the railway operation relies on cyber-physical systems (CPS) systems. This work presents SPD-Safe-an administration framework for railway CPS, leveraging artificial intelligence for monitoring and managing the system in real-time. The network layer protections integrated provide the core security properties of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, along with energy-aware secure routing and authorization. The effectiveness in mitigating attacks and the efficiency under normal operation are assessed through simulations with the average delay in real equipment being 0.2-0.6 s. SPD metrics are incorporated together with safety semantics for the application environment. Considering an intelligent transportation scenario, SPD-Safe is deployed on railway critical infrastructure, safeguarding one outdoor setting on the railway's tracks and one in-carriage setting on a freight train that contains dangerous cargo. As demonstrated, SPD-Safe provides higher security and scalability, while enhancing safety response procedures. Nonetheless, emergence response operations require a seamless interoperation of the railway system with emergency authorities' equipment (e.g., drones). Therefore, a secure integration with external systems is considered as future work.

AB Security of Critical National Infrastructures (CNI) is one of the major concerns to countries both in a European and in a worldwide level. Training on scenarios that involve such systems is important to the effective handling of incidents. Experiential learning is based on the importance of involvement and active engagement of attendees to develop personal experiences and increase the understanding of the investigated topic. This article describes a final year module for teaching traffic anomaly detection, an important part of of network security methods, to Computer Science and Informatics students. The course consists of 12 week labs and lectures run at De Montfort University. Students learn how to combine programming, data mining and security skills in order to build their own Intrusion Detection System using data from a small-scale SCADA testbed.

AB Cyber-attacks on industrial companies have increased in the last years. The Industrial Internet of Things increases production efficiency, at the cost of an enlarged attack surface. Physical separation of productive networks has fallen prey to the paradigm of interconnectivity, presented by the Industrial Internet of Things. This leads to an increased demand for industrial intrusion detection solutions. There are, however, challenges in implementing industrial intrusion detection. There are hardly any data sets publicly available that can be used to evaluate intrusion detection algorithms. The biggest threat for industrial applications arises from state-sponsored and criminal groups. Often, formerly unknown exploits are employed by these attackers, so-called 0-day exploits. They cannot be discovered with signature-based intrusion detection. Thus, statistical or machine learning based anomaly detection lends itself readily. These methods especially, however, need a large amount of labelled training data. In this work, an exemplary industrial use case with real-world industrial hardware is presented. Siemens S7 Programmable Logic Controllers are used to control a real world-based control application using the OPC UA protocol: A pump, filling and emptying water tanks. This scenario is used to generate application specific network data. Furthermore, attacks are introduced into this data set. This is done in three ways: First, the normal process is monitored and captured. Common attacks are then synthetically introduced into this data set. Second, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller program and executed live, the traffic is captured as well. Third, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller while still keeping the same output behaviour as in normal operation. An attacker could exploit an application but forge valid sensor output so that no anomaly is detected. Sensors are employed, capturing temperature, sound and flow of water to create data that can be correlated to the network data and used to still detect the attack. All data is labelled, containing the ground truth, meaning all attacks are known and no unknown attacks occur. This makes them perfect for training of anomaly detection algorithms. The data is published to enable security researchers to evaluate intrusion detection solutions.

ID SECURITY
AB Modern indusfrial control systems (ICS) are increasingly becoming targets of cyber attacks. Traditional security tools based on a signature approach are not always able to detect a new attack, the signature of which has not yet been described. In particular, this occurs during targeted attacks on indusfrial facilities. Cyber attacks can cause anomalies in the operation of an industrial control system and process equipment under its control. Therefore, to detect attacks, it is advisable to use an approach based on the detection of anomalies. A reasonable way to implement this approach is to use machine learning techniques. The paper deals with the most common methods of machine learning (decision free algorithms, linear algorithms, support vector machine) and neural networks. To assess their applicability in the problem of detection of ICS anomalies, the Additional Tennessee Eastman Process Simulation Data for Anomaly Detection Evaluation and Gas Pipeline datasets were used.

AB With the increasing deployment of 6G networks in all industries, there is a growing risk of vulnerability and complexity due to continuous data flow from edge devices to specialized computers. One potential threat to 6G networks is fuzzing attacks, which involve sending random and invalid inputs to identify vulnerabilities and flaws. A successful fuzzing attack could compromise the network's protocols, interfaces, and security mechanisms, leading to potential disruption or compromise of critical infrastructure. The proposed framework involves gathering relevant data from different sources within the 6G network and pre-processing it to prepare for analysis. Relevant features that indicate the presence of anomalies are identified using Tuna Swarm Optimization (TSO) Algorithm. The Multi-Scale Convolutional Auto Encoder (MSCAE) is then utilized by the proposed model to extract the feature and classify data. The intrusion Detection System is built to monitor and classify nodes producing anomalies. The proposed model is assessed utilizing various metrics, including recall, precision, accuracy, detection latency, and F1 score. The proposed framework achieved 97.50% accuracy, 94.81% precision, 93.50% F1-score, and 94.50% recall with notable improvements that surmount the deficiencies of previous studies. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient and safe than current edge security methods, potentially mitigating the risk of fuzzing attacks in 6G networks.

AB Industrial control systems (ICSs) are crucial in managing critical infrastructure, making their security a paramount concern. In recent years, their widespread adoption, together with the overall distance spanned by the critical infrastructure of industrial communication networks, have increased the complexity of the networks' topological arrangement, increasing their structural vulnerabilities. In this scenario, deep-learning models, especially those that incorporate graph-aware mechanisms, have arisen as a promising solution. This article presents a novel centrality- and graph-aware attack detector (CGAAD) that includes nodes' significance by centrality measures within a graph convolution network (GCN) framework to provide superior cyberattack detection performance and increase the resilience of critical ICS infrastructure. The proposed CGAAD model is in three parts. First, centrality measures are used as features for each of the nodes in the ICS graph topology. Then, a sparse-autoencoder (sparse-AE) enhances the feature representations to harness the subsequent classification step. Finally, the GCN leverages the graph structure and the enhanced features to classify dataflow between nodes as either normal or attacked. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance, reaching nearly 99% in terms of accuracy and F1-score, reducing misclassifications of both normal and attacked samples, which is crucial in ICS critical infrastructure applications.

AB A lot of machine learning methods and expert systems are used in network intrusion detection automation. When different industrial control systems merge with the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, they become vulnerable to cyber-attacks in critical infrastructure situations requiring communication technologies. Conventional machine learning techniques used for network anomaly detection are ineffective due to the substantial amount of network traffic within important Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). In this manuscript, Cyberattack Identification Through Ensemble Deep Learning in an IoT environment is proposed. Initially, the input network traffic data are taken from the IoT-23 dataset. Then the network traffic data are preprocessed using Z-Score normalization to reduce any irrelevant or erroneous data from the input dataset. Then the relevant features are selected using the Gorilla Troops Optimization (GTO) algorithm. Afterwards, the selected features are fed into the ensemble classification model based on Random Space (RS), Random Tree (RT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN). Among the several ensembling techniques, GCNN can achieve better performance. Python is used to accomplish the suggested technique. The performance of the proposed GCNN method provides 12.09%, 4.34%, and 3.21% higher accuracy than the other models like RS, RT and XGBoost respectively.

   IIoT Security
AB The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a paradigm that enables the integration of cyber-physical systems in critical infrastructures, such as power grids, water distribution networks, and transportation systems. IIoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and controllers, can provide various benefits, such as performance optimization, efficiency improvement, and remote management. However, these devices also pose new security risks and challenges, as they can be targeted by malicious actors to disrupt the normal operation of the infrastructures they are connected to or to cause physical damage or harm. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective and intelligent solutions to detect and prevent attacks on IIoT devices and to ensure the security and resilience of critical infrastructures. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the types and impacts of attacks on IIoT devices based on a literature review and a data analysis of real-world incidents. We classify the attacks into four categories: denial-of-service, data manipulation, device hijacking, and physical tampering. We also discuss the potential consequences of these attacks on the safety, reliability, and availability of critical infrastructures. We then propose an expert system that can detect and prevent attacks on IIoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques, such as rule-based reasoning, anomaly detection, and reinforcement learning. We describe the architecture and implementation of our system, which consists of three main components: a data collector, a data analyzer, and a data actuator. We also present a table that summarizes the main features and capabilities of our system compared to existing solutions. We evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our system on a testbed consisting of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and IIoT protocols, such as Modbus and MQTT. We simulate various attacks on IIoT devices and measure the accuracy, latency, and overhead of our system. Our results show that our system can successfully detect and mitigate different types of attacks on IIoT devices with high accuracy and low latency and overhead. We also demonstrate that our system can enhance the security and resilience of critical infrastructures by preventing or minimizing the impacts of attacks on IIoT devices.

AB With the explosive growth of the Industrial Internet scale, cyberattacks targeting industrial control systems also increased. The management and operation of Industrial Internet are usually performed via web servers which retain a large attack surface. In the Industrial Internet, attackers usually exploit vulnerabilities to inject malicious codes for remotely executing commands, stealing confidential data, and invading web servers. Existing approaches capture statistical and contextual dependence information from Webshell using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms. However, the semantic feature mining of program code within Webshell is not sufficient when entering new types of Webshell. In this paper, we propose a graph learningbased PHP Webshell detection framework, GlareShell, using the word embedding technique, a risk weight allocation mechanism, and the graph neural network (GNN). First, GlareShell leverages static analysis to extract interprocedural control flow graphs (ICFGs) from PHP script files and then prunes these ICFGs to remove noisy statements. Then, word embedding techniques are employed to generate semantic representations from PHP statements. Next, we design a risk weight allocation mechanism to derive the risk levels of statements and concatenate them with word embeddings as attributions. The identified risk levels could guide the passing of potential attack patterns inside GNN models. Finally, GlareShell builds a GNN classifier directly from the ICFG with corresponding node attributions to identify the malicious PHP scripts. Experiment results on collected datasets prove the promise of our graph learning framework in the Webshell detection domain.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS) play a vital role in modern society across various sectors, ranging from smart grid to water treatment, and their security has become one of the major concerns. Due to the significantly growing complexity and scale of CPS and cyber-attacks, it is imperative to develop defense and prevention strategies specifically for CPS that are adaptive, scalable, and robust. An important research and application direction in this domain is time series anomaly detection within CPS utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning. However, many anomaly detectors fail to balance between detection performance and computational overhead, limiting their applicability in CPS. In this paper, we introduce a novel agent-based dynamic thresholding (ADT) method based on the deep reinforcement learning technique, i.e. deep Q-network (DQN), to model thresholding in anomaly detection as a Markov decision process. By utilizing anomaly scores generated from an autoencoder and other useful information perceived from a simulated environment, ADT performs the optimal dynamic thresholding control, facilitating real -time adaptive anomaly detection for time series. Rigorous evaluations were conducted on realistic datasets from water treatment and industrial control systems, specifically SWaT, WADI, and HAI, comparing against established benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate ADT's superior detection performance, dynamic thresholding capability, dataefficient learning, and robustness. Notably, ADT, even when trained on minimal labeled data, consistently outperforms benchmarks with F1 scores ranging from 0.995 to 0.999 across all datasets. It is effective even in challenging scenarios where the environmental feedback is noisy, delayed, or partial. Beyond its direct application as an advanced anomaly detector, ADT possesses the versatility to act as a lightweight dynamic thresholding controller, boosting other anomaly detection models. This underscores ADT's considerable promise in sophisticated and dynamic CPS environments.

AB As the threat landscape for Operational Technology (OT) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems grows more complex, there is a pressing need for intrusion detection systems that can dynamically adapt to evolving attack patterns. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) approaches often require frequent manual retraining and struggle to respond efficiently to these dynamic threats. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models present a promising solution, offering autonomous learning capabilities, adaptability to diverse scenarios with minimal human intervention, and enhanced intrusion detection for Industrial Control Systems (ICS). This paper presents a novel investigation into the application of various DRL models, including Deep Q-Network (DQN), Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN), REINFORCE, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), for network intrusion detection in ICS. Performance comparisons with traditional ML methods are conducted using relevant metrics. To assess their effectiveness without a live environment, labeled pre-recorded intrusion datasets are utilized, with tailored adaptations for DRL model training outlined. These adaptations include generating data samples in mini-batches, integrating small discount factors, and employing straightforward reward functions. Comprehensive results underscore the efficacy of DRL models in bolstering the detection of advanced cyberattacks within OT environments, surpassing conventional ML approaches.

AB Organizations face attacks on industrial control systems (ICS) as vulnerabilities are pervasive. However, patching vulnerable systems by simply updating to the newest version is often not an option and shifts focus to workarounds. Beyond pure patching, workarounds specify other remediation measures (e.g., firewall or VPN configuration) that must be taken due to system availability requirements, complexity, or heterogeneous devices. In this paper, we introduce vulnerability playbooks based on open standards. Pushing the envelope of cybersecurity playbooks-steps organizations should follow when responding to cybersecurity incidents reactively-for ICS vulnerability management offers organizations a more transparent, repeatable process and faster, possibly automated actions. We have designed a process model to collect and transform security advisories in Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) format and generate Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) playbooks based on listed remediation advice. With a proof of concept, we demonstrate that structured CSAF documents can be seamlessly transformed into CACAO playbooks. For our industrial use case, we must also use unstructured security advice highlighting quality differences (compared to CSAF). Our generated 79 standard conformant CACAO playbooks with 485 identified actions hint at imbalanced advice toward patching. Preferably, vendors should include detailed technical remediation advice, provide APIs, and go beyond patching recommendations in their security advisories. Subscribers should structure their assets and use machine learning to normalize, generate, and prioritize CACAO playbooks. With CSAF and CACAO, we see two open standards for handling vulnerabilities.

DE ransomware; Generative Adversarial Network; minimax loss function;
   ransomware detection and prediction; deep learning
AB Recent ransomware attacks threaten not only personal files but also critical infrastructure like smart grids, necessitating early detection before encryption occurs. Current methods, reliant on pre-encryption data, suffer from insufficient and rapidly outdated attack patterns, despite efforts to focus on select features. Such an approach assumes that the same features remain unchanged. This approach proves ineffective due to the polymorphic and metamorphic characteristics of ransomware, which generate unique attack patterns for each new target, particularly in the pre-encryption phase where evasiveness is prioritized. As a result, the selected features quickly become obsolete. Therefore, this study proposes an enhanced Bi-Gradual Minimax (BGM) loss function for the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Algorithm that compensates for the attack patterns insufficiency to represents the polymorphic behavior at the earlier phases of the ransomware lifecycle. Unlike existing GAN-based models, the BGM-GAN gradually minimizes the maximum loss of the generator and discriminator in the network. This allows the generator to create artificial patterns that resemble the pre-encryption data distribution. The generator is used to craft evasive adversarial patterns and add them to the original data. Then, the generator and discriminator compete to optimize their weights during the training phase such that the generator produces realistic attack patterns, while the discriminator endeavors to distinguish between the real and crafted patterns. The experimental results show that the proposed BGM-GAN reached maximum accuracy of 0.98, recall (0.96), and a minimum false positive rate (0.14) which all outperform those obtained by the existing works. The application of BGM-GAN can be extended to early detect malware and other types of attacks.

ID CHALLENGES
AB The current mainstream intrusion detection models often have a high false negative rate, significantly affecting intrusion detection systems' (IDSs) practicability. To address this issue, we propose an intrusion detection model based on a multi-scale one-dimensional convolutional neural network module (MS1DCNN), an efficient channel attention module (ECA), and two bidirectional long short-term memory modules (BiLSTMs). The proposed hybrid MS1DCNN-ECA-BiLSTM model uses the MS1DCNN module to extract features with a different granularity from the input data and uses the ECA module to enhance the weight of important features. Finally, the model carries out sequence learning through two BiLSTM layers. We use the dung beetle optimizer (DBO) to optimize the hyperparameters in the model to obtain better classification results. Additionally, we use the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to fill several samples to reduce the local false negative rate. In this paper, we train and test the model using accurate network data from a water storage industrial control system. In the multi-classification experiment, the model's accuracy was 97.04%, the precision was 97.17%, and the false negative rate was 2.95%; in the binary classification experiment, the accuracy and false negative rate were 99.30% and 0.7%. Compared with other mainstream methods, our model has a higher score. This study provides a new algorithm for the intrusion detection of industrial control systems.

AB Modbus/RS-485 is one of the most popular standards used worldwide at the edges of industrial control systems (ICSs) as field buses. These networks were traditionally secured by isolating them from others, but nowadays, they are connected and function as components of a whole ICS. An attack on a field bus will deceive global control and can result in severe security incidents. In this article, we propose a novel unobtrusive communication signal monitoring method for attack detection on this type of field bus with machine learning. We define five types of field-bus attacks and develop datasets with ground truth labels on our real-world testbed. In our performance evaluation, supervised learning with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) achieved the best with an accuracy of 0.9999 for attack detection and classification. 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) achieved alternatively. Unsupervised learning with an MLP-autoencoder achieved the area under the curves of receiver operating characteristics between 0.9992 and 0.9999 for anomaly detection. These results indicate that our proposed unobtrusive monitoring method can achieve a high detection rate for field-bus attacks.

AB With the rapid development of technology, more malicious traffic data brought negative influences on industrial areas. Modbus protocol plays a momentous role in the communications of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), but it's vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks(DoS). Traditional detection methods cannot perform well on fine-grained detection tasks which could contribute to locating targets of attacks and preventing the destruction. Considering the temporal locality and high dimension of malicious traffic, this paper proposed a Neural Network architecture named MODLSTM, which consists of three parts: input preprocessing, feature recoding, and traffic classification. By virtue of the design, MODLSTM can form continuous stream semantics based on fragmented packets, discover potential low-dimensional features and finally classify traffic at a fine-grained level. To test the model's performances, some experiments were conducted on industrial and public datasets, and the models achieved excellent performances in comparison with previous work(accuracy increased by 0.71% and 0.07% respectively). The results show that the proposed method has more satisfactory abilities to detect DoS attacks related to Modbus, compared with other works. It could help to build a reliable firewall to address a variety of malicious traffic in diverse situations, especially in industrial environments.

AB In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely adopted as anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System in order to evaluate cyber and physical attacks against Industrial Control Systems. Nevertheless, a performance comparison of such techniques applied to multiple Cyber-Physical Systems datasets is still missing. In light of this, we propose a comparative study about the performance of four supervised ML-algorithms, Random Forest, k-nearest-Neighbors, Support-Vector-Machine and Naive-Bayes, applied to three different publicly available datasets from water testbeds. Specifically, w e consider three different scenarios where we evaluate: (1) the ability to detect cyber and physical anomalies with respect to the nominal samples, (2) the ability to detect specific t ypes o f c yber and physical attacks and (3) the ability to recognize unforeseen attacks without providing any previous knowledge about them. Results show the effectiveness of the ML-techniques in identifying cyber and physical anomalies under some assumptions about their effects on the process dynamics.

AB Industrial control systems (ICS) provide critical functions to society and are enticing attack targets. Machine learning (ML) modelsin particular, reconstruction-based ML models-are commonly used to identify attacks during ICS operation. However, the variety of ML model architectures, datasets, metrics, and techniques used in prior work makes broad comparisons and identifying optimal solutions difficult. To assist ICS security practitioners in choosing and configuring the most effective reconstruction-based anomaly detector for their ICS environment, this paper: (1) comprehensively evaluates previously proposed reconstruction-based ICS anomaly-detection approaches, and (2) shows that commonly used metrics for evaluating ML algorithms, like the point-F1 score, are inadequate for evaluating anomaly detection systems for practical use. Among our findings is that the performance of anomaly-detection systems is not closely tied to the choice of ML model architecture or hyperparameters, and that the models proposed in prior work are often larger than necessary. We also show that evaluating ICS anomaly detection over temporal ranges, e.g., with the range-F1 metric, better describes ICS anomaly-detection performance than the commonly used point-F1 metric. These so-called range-based metrics measure objectives more specific to ICS environments, such as reducing false alarms or reducing detection latency. We further show that using range-based metrics to evaluate candidate anomaly detectors leads to different conclusions about what anomaly-detection strategies are optimal.

AB Featured Application: We present a deep-learning-based pipeline to solve a novel problem in Cybersecurity and Industry 4.0. Our proposal, which automatically classifies screenshots of industrial control systems, might support the task of an industrial monitoring tool for detecting vulnerable or exposed industrial control systems on the internet, which might be related to critical infrastructures.
   Industrial control systems depend heavily on security and monitoring protocols. Several tools are available for this purpose, which scout vulnerabilities and take screenshots of various control panels for later analysis. However, they do not adequately classify images into specific control groups, which is crucial for security-based tasks performed by manual operators. To solve this problem, we propose a pipeline based on deep learning to classify snapshots of industrial control panels into three categories: internet technologies, operation technologies, and others. More specifically, we compare the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on ImageNet to select the best CNN architecture for classifying the screenshots of industrial control systems. We propose the critical infrastructure dataset (CRINF-300), which is the first publicly available information technology (IT)/operational technology (OT) snapshot dataset, with 337 manually labeled images. We used the CRINF-300 to train and evaluate eighteen different pipelines, registering their performance under CPU and GPU environments. We found out that the Inception-ResNet-V2 and VGG16 architectures obtained the best results on transfer learning and fine-tuning, with F1-scores of 0.9832 and 0.9373, respectively. In systems where time is critical and the GPU is available, we recommend using the MobileNet-V1 architecture, with an average time of 0.03 s to process an image and with an F1-score of 0.9758.

AB Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks provide high situational awareness and automation control for industrial control systems, whilst introducing a wide range of access points for cyber attackers. To address these issues, a line of machine learning or deep learning based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been presented in the literature, where a large number of attack examples are usually demanded. However, in real-world SCADA networks, attack examples are not always sufficient, having only a few shots in many cases. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning based IDS, named FS-IDS, to detect cyber attacks against SCADA networks, especially when having only a few attack examples in the defenders' hands. Specifically, a new method by orchestrating one-hot encoding and principal component analysis is developed, to preprocess SCADA datasets containing sufficient examples for frequent cyber attacks. Then, a few-shot learning based preliminary IDS model is designed and trained using the preprocessed data. Last, a complete FS-IDS model for SCADA networks is established by further training the preliminary IDS model with a few examples for cyber attacks of interest. The high effectiveness of the proposed FS-IDS, in detecting cyber attacks against SCADA networks with only a few examples, is demonstrated by extensive experiments on a real SCADA dataset.

AB Due to the evolving Cyber threat landscape, Cyber criminals have found new and ingenious ways of breaching defenses in networks. Due to the sheer destruction these threat actors can cause to an organization, most modern-day organizations have focused their attention towards protecting their critical infrastructure and sensitive information through multiple methods. The main defense against both internal and external threats to an organization has been the implementation of the Security Operations Center (SOC) which is responsible for monitoring, analyzing and mitigating incoming threats. At the heart of the Security Operations Center, lies the Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM) which is utilized by SOC analysts as the centralized point where all security notifications from various security technologies including firewalls, IPS/IDS and Anti-Virus logs are collected and visualized. The effective operation of SOC in an organization is dependent on how well the SIEM filters log events and generates actual alerts. Here lies the major problem faced by SOC analysts in detecting threats. If proper alert correlation is not accomplished, analysts would have to deal with too much alert noise due to a high false positive count. This would ultimately cause analysts to miss critical security incidents, thus causing severe implications to the organization's security. The performance of a SIEM can be enhanced through adding various functionalities such as Threat Hunting, Threat Intelligence and malware identification and prevention in order to reduce false positive alarms, threat framework and machine learning which would increase the accuracy and efficiency of the overall Security Operations process of an organization. Even though many products which provide these additional functionalities exist in the current market, they can be too expensive for smaller scale organizations to handle. Our aim is to make security operations deliverable to any organization regardless of the size and scale without any financial implications and enhance its functionalities with the aid of Advanced Machine Learning Techniques.

AB "The reality of today from a cyber-security point of view - I think some of the top people predict that the next big war is fought on cyber-security." - Tim Cook
   Cyber-security in aviation is the practice of protecting the computer systems of airlines from threats and attacks which could cause significant damage to both life and critical resources. With the advent of new technologies such as IoT, cloud computing and storage and machine learning, etc. which are being used in aviation, the focus on securing the systems from cyber-attacks pertaining to these technologies haven't been given much importance. The paper discusses the recent need of cyber-security in aviation due to attacks which could cripple the airline as well as cause significant loss of life. The issues in securing the aviation sector from cyber-attacks stem from a lack of resources, funds, skilled staff etc. Insider threat and securing cutting edge operational technologies such as SCADA, ICS also pose a problem. The paper explores the challenges which plague the aviation sector in fighting cyber-attacks successfully. Finally, this paper presents solutions on how to tackle the issues present to make the aviation industry safe from cyber-attacks

TI Dual-hybrid intrusion detection system to detect False Data Injection in

SO PLOS ONE

ID FEATURE-SELECTION; ATTACKS
AB Modernizing power systems into smart grids has introduced numerous benefits, including enhanced efficiency, reliability, and integration of renewable energy sources. However, this advancement has also increased vulnerability to cyber threats, particularly False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often fall short in identifying sophisticated FDIAs due to their reliance on predefined rules and signatures. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel IDS that utilizes hybrid feature selection and deep learning classifiers to detect FDIAs in smart grids. The main objective is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of IDS in smart grids. The proposed methodology combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) for hybrid feature selection, ensuring the selection of the most relevant features for detecting FDIAs. Additionally, the IDS employs a hybrid deep learning classifier that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture the smart grid data's spatial and temporal features. The dataset used for evaluation, the Industrial Control System (ICS) Cyber Attack Dataset (Power System Dataset) consists of various FDIA scenarios simulated in a smart grid environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IDS framework significantly outperforms traditional methods. The hybrid feature selection effectively reduces the dimensionality of the dataset, improving computational efficiency and detection performance. The hybrid deep learning classifier performs better in key metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure. Precisely, the proposed approach attains higher accuracy by accurately identifying true positives and minimizing false negatives, ensuring the reliable operation of smart grids. Recall is enhanced by capturing critical features relevant to all attack types, while precision is improved by reducing false positives, leading to fewer unnecessary interventions. The F-measure balances recall and precision, indicating a robust and reliable detection system. This study presents a practical dual-hybrid IDS framework for detecting FDIAs in smart grids, addressing the limitations of existing IDS techniques. Future research should focus on integrating real-world smart grid data for validation, developing adaptive learning mechanisms, exploring other bio-inspired optimization algorithms, and addressing real-time processing and scalability challenges in large-scale deployments.

AB The swift advancement of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) across sectors such as healthcare, transportation, critical infrastructure, and energy enhances the crucial requirement for robust cybersecurity measures to protect these systems from cyberattacks. The cyber-physical method is a hybrid of cyber and physical components, and a safety breach in the element is central to catastrophic consequences. Cyberattack recognition and mitigation techniques in CPSs include using numerous models like intrusion detection systems (IDSs), access control mechanisms, encryption, and firewalls. Cyberattack detection employing deep learning (DL) contains training neural networks to identify patterns indicative of malicious actions within system logs or network traffic, allowing positive classification and mitigation of cyber-attacks. By leveraging the integral ability of DL methods to learn complex representations, this technique enhances the accuracy and efficiency of detecting diverse and growing cyber-attacks. Thus, the study proposes an automated Cyberattack Detection using Binary Metaheuristics with Deep Learning (ACAD-BMDL) method in a CPS environment. The ACAD-BMDL method mainly focuses on enhancing security in the CPS environment via the cyberattack detection process. The ACAD-BMDL method uses Z-score normalization to scale the input dataset. In addition, the binary grey wolf optimizer (BGWO) model is utilized to choose an optimal feature subset. Moreover, the Enhanced Elman Spike Neural Network (EESNN) model detects cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AOA) model is employed to select the optimum hyperparameter for the EESNN model. The empirical analysis of the ACAD-BMDL technique is performed on a benchmark dataset. The experimental validation of the ACAD-BMDL technique portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.12% and 99.36% under NSLKDD2015 and CICIDS2017 datasets in the CPS environment.

AB Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are critical to the efficient operation of essential sectors such as manufacturing, energy, and water management. However, their increasing integration with IT systems exposes them to sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly lateral attacks targeting Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). Advanced preventive measures are necessary because, despite their significance, many ICS continue to rely on outdated technologies with few security features. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based approach to anomaly detection in ICS communication networks, focusing on techniques such as 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithms. We generated a dataset by capturing both normal and manipulated ICS communication patterns, including TCP/IP traffic. Simulated lateral attacks provided realistic data for training and testing the ML models. The results demonstrate that the 1D CNN model achieved the highest accuracy (0.92) and F1 score (0.91) with minimal processing time, making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection. This research highlights the potential of ML techniques to fortify ICS cybersecurity and lays the groundwork for future advancements in critical infrastructure resilience.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB detection in the industrial internet of things (IIoT) devices is significant due to its fundamental role in protecting modern critical infrastructure. In the IIoT, anomaly detection can be carried out by training machine learning models. Data sharing between factories can expand the data from which the model is trained, thus improving the performance of the model. However, due to the sensitivity and privacy of IIoT data, it is also difficult to build a high-performance anomaly detection model between factories. To address this problem, we design an anomaly detection method for IIoT devices combined blockchain of main-side structure and federated learning. We store the global model on the main-chain while the side-chain records the hash value of the global models and local models, which updated by participating nodes, controlling nodes access to the global model through the main-side blockchain and the smart contracts. Only the nodes participating in the current federated learning training can get the latest global model, so as to encourage the nodes to take part in the training of the global model. We designed a proof of accuracy consensus algorithm, and select the nodes to participate in training according to the accuracy of the local model on the test dataset to resist the poisoning attack of the models. We also use the local differential privacy (LDP) algorithm to protect user data privacy from model inference attacks by adding noise to the local model. Finally, we propose a new algorithm named Fed Acc to keep the accuracy of the global model stable when the users add a lot of noise to their local models.

AB Network attacks pose a significant challenge for smart grid networks, mainly due to the existence of several multi-directional communication devices coupling con-sumers to the grid. One of the network attacks that can affect the smart grid is the distributed denial of service (DDoS), where numerous compromised communication devices/nodes of the grid flood the smart grid network with false data and requests, leading to disruptions in smart meters, data servers, and the state estimator, ultimately effecting the services for end-users. Machine learning-based strategies show distinctive benefits in resolving the challenge of securing the network from DDoS attacks. Regardless, a notable hindrance in deploying machine learning-based techniques is the requirement of model retraining whenever new attack classes arise. Practically, disrupting the normal operations of smart grid is really discouraged. To handle this challenge effectively and detect DDoS attacks without major disruptions, we propose the deployment of reconstructive deep learning techniques. A primary benefit of our proposed technique is the minimum disruption during the introduction of a new attack class, even after complete deployment. We trained several deep and shallow reconstructive models to get representations for each attack type separately, and we performed attack detection by class-specific reconstruction error-based classification. Our technique experienced rigid evaluation via multiple experiments using two well -acknowledged standard databases exclusively for DDoS attacks, including their subsets. Later, we performed a comparative estimation of our outcomes against six methods prevalent within the same domain. Our outcomes reveal that our technique attained higher accuracy, and notably eliminates the requirement of a complete model retraining in the event of the introduction of new attack classes. This method will not only boost the security of smart grid networks but also ensure the stability and reliability of normal operations, protecting the critical infrastructure from ever-evolving network attacks. As smart grid is advancing rapidly, our approach proposes a robust and adaptive way to overcome the continuous challenges posed by network attacks.

TI Causality-Guided Counterfactual Debiasing for Anomaly Detection of
   Cyber-Physical Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS

DT Article
DE Anomaly detection; counterfactual inference; cyber-physical systems
   (CPSs); bias estimation; bias mitigation
AB Machine learning has become a promising technology for anomaly detection of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). However, the trained anomaly detection models always suffer from bias due to the scarcity of anomaly data in CPSs and the biased data collection process, which may poison the models' generalization ability. Recent debiasing methods are proposed to deal with the bias via resampling the training dataset, reweighting during the training phase, or adjusting the classification threshold. However, they may lose valuable information, need extra knowledge of the models, or lead to overfitting. Especially, they lack a causal understanding of the debiasing process, so they cannot point out the source and propagation of the bias and, thus, cannot deal with it in an explainable way. In this article, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework to mitigate the bias in a well-trained model. First, we formalize the model's training and inference processes using causal graphs. Thus, we can understand the source and propagation of the model's bias through causal inference. Then, we use counterfactual inference to estimate the bias's detrimental causal effect on the prediction and remove it from the total causal effect. Therefore, we can conduct unbiased inferences with a biased model. The proposed method can remove the bias in an explainable way by incorporating causal graphs. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on seven real-world CPS datasets, i.e., IDA, MFP, ACS, SPF, UNS, NSL, and ICS. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, compatibility, and unbiasedness of the proposed approach.

AB Anomaly detection methods based on machine learning assist in identifying attacker behavior concealed in critical infrastructure's high-speed network traffic. However, these methods generally experience problems including a lack of labeled data and poor performance. We suggest a detection method based on staged frequency domain features to address these issues. A small-step sliding window is used in the training phase to fully understand the frequency domain features of the traffic. We suggest SOM-Kmeans, an integrated clustering technique that can accurately distinguish between malicious and benign flows. We evaluate the SOM-Kmeans accuracy using open datasets and assess its effectiveness in a real network environment. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can detect anomaly traffic at high speed without sacrificing detection accuracy.

DE Critical infrastructure; linear processing; recurrent learning;
   resilience
AB Critical infrastructures are designed for securing interconnecting networks from different influencing factors such as adversaries, unauthorized platoons, cyber threats, etc. These infrastructure hosts include human, physical elements, and cyber paradigms. The vital part is cyber resilience against weak and volatile authentication and security administrations. For strengthening cyber security, this article introduces the Artificial Intelligence-induced Constructive Resilience Model (AI-CRM). The proposed model accounts for the security requirements of the adversary impacting infrastructure elements based on probability. This probability is computed using previous adversary impacts on infrastructure failures and session drops in handling operational services. The computation for linearity or stagnancy is validated using a recurrent learning paradigm over different service transitions. The resilience is improved by augmenting security measures that are identified as an output of linear impacts over the services. Based on the linear incremental probability the resilience between two successive service transitions is computed. Identifying the non-linear or stagnant probability is the converging solution of recurrent learning. The recurrent learning optimizes the stagnancy and linear impact (probability) by repeatedly computing the failures and drops due to adversary injection. This improves resilience through security augmentations and modifications. This model is analyzed using adversary detection ratio, session drops, infrastructure failures, time lag, and service dissemination ratio.

AB Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) constitute the functioning basis of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and hence are often a focal point for attackers to exploit. Previous attacks have seen PLC memory maliciously altered in order to disrupt the underlying physical process. Different types of memory attack can cause a similar impact on the PLC's operation and result in indistinguishable physical manifestations. Consequently, delays in triaging attacks through digital forensic practices can induce significant financial loss, physical damage to the infrastructure, and degradation of safety. In this work, we propose PLCPrint, a novel vendor-independent fingerprinting approach that utilises PLC memory artefacts to perform detection and classification of memory attacks. PLCPrint uses PLC memory register mapping, a novel method exploiting the relationship between PLC registers and memory artefacts including the PLC application code. Through this, registers are assigned a Mapping Condition (MC) to indicate how they exist within the PLC memory artefacts. We evaluate the performance of PLCPrint over realistic emulations conducted at a real testbed emulating water filtration and distribution. Through PLCPrint we depict how MC deviations are utilised within supervised learning schemes such as to adequately classify PLC memory attacks with high accuracy performance. In general, we demonstrate that PLCPrint fills the gap in the context of attack technique triaging since this has been a missing element within current ICS forensics schemes.

AB Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have been a major challenge in securing both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems. APT is a sophisticated attack that masquerade their actions to navigates around defenses, breach networks, often, over multiple network hosts and evades detection. It also uses "low-and-slow" approach over a long period of time. Resource availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the operational cyber-physical systems (CPS) state and control is highly impacted by the safety and security measures in place. A framework multi-stage detection approach termed "APT(DASAC)" to detect different tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used during various APT steps is proposed. Implementation was carried out in three stages: (i) Data input and probing layer - this involves data gathering and pre-processing, (ii) Data analysis layer; applies the core process of "APT(DASAC)" to learn the behaviour of attack steps from the sequence data, correlate and link the related output and, (iii) Decision layer; the ensemble probability approach is utilized to integrate the output and make attack prediction. The framework was validated with three different datasets and three case studies. The proposed approach achieved a significant attacks detection capability of 86.36% with loss as 0.32%, demonstrating that attack detection techniques applied that performed well in one domain may not yield the same good result in another domain. This suggests that robustness and resilience of operational systems state to withstand attack and maintain system performance are regulated by the safety and security measures in place, which is specific to the system in question.

AB In light of the advancement of the technologies used in industrial control systems, securing their operation has become crucial, primarily since their activity is consistently associated with integral elements related to the environment, the safety and health of people, the economy, and many others. This work presents a distributed, machine learning based attack detection and mitigation framework for sensor false data injection cyber-physical attacks in industrial control systems. It is developed using the system's standard operational data and validated using a hybrid testbed of a reverse osmosis plant. A MATLAB/Simulink-based simulation model of the process validated with actual data from a local plant is used. The control system is implemented using Siemens S7-1200 programmable logic controllers with 200SP Distributed Input/Output modules. The proposed solution can be adopted in the existing industrial control systems and demonstrated effective performance in real-time detection and mitigation of actual cyber-physical attacks launched by compromising the communication links between the process and the programmable logic controllers.

ID DEEP LEARNING APPROACH; INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) have entered an era of modernization enabled by the recent progress in Information Technologies (IT), particularly the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This enables better automation of industrial processes but now exposes the ICSs to cyber-attacks that exploit the IIoT vulnerabilities. Thus, to ensure ICSs security, numerous research works have focused on designing Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPSs), and deep learning has recently received considerable attention, as it has the potential to improve detection accuracy. However, most of the proposed deep learning solutions focus only on the model's accuracy without considering latency, which is an essential requirement in many ICSs. The novelty of this paper is the time complexity analysis of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and the design of a low latency and robust deep learning-based collaborative IDPS. The proposed architecture employs two classification models. In the first model, a lightweight DNN is used to perform a binary classification, i.e., normal or attack, which ensures rapid intrusion detection. A second model ensures the identification of the type of attacks by performing a multi-class classification of the detected anomaly, which is handled by a robust and complex DNN in order to achieve higher accuracy. This research also proposes intrusion response measures to deal with detected attacks, first after the anomaly detection, and then after the identification of the attack type. An experimental evaluation has been provided using various detection features, datasets, DNN algorithms, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

TI Anomaly detection for ICS based on deep learning: a use case for
   aeronautical radar data
SO ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
LA English

DE Anomaly detection; Industrial control systems; Deep learning;
   Cybersecurity
AB Industrial control systems (ICS) are no longer restricted to industrial production. They are also at the heart of safety critical systems and carry out key information that require strong need in terms of availability and integrity. Furthermore, they are gradually connected with the Internet. In the context of Air Traffic Management, safety critical data are generally time series which contain periodic events. Anomalies can hardly be detected as we only have a little knowledge of the traffic characteristic and the kind of anomalies we might encounter. Consequently, detecting them is challenging as it requires high detection accuracy currently unfeasible with traditional methods based on anomaly signatures or predictions. To cope with this issue, we introduce an anomaly detection method for ICS based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) that outperforms the accuracy of traditional ones. We experiment and develop our method with one major dataset containing French civil radar aviation data. We then evaluate our scheme with different datasets containing ICS monitoring data (publicly available predictable time series data) and show that our autoencoder can detect anomalies from predictable times series and present a higher detection rate on average than traditional detection methods.

AB Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a very useful tool not only to manage networks but also to increase network security, in particular by implementing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) directly into the SDN architecture. The implementation of IDS within the SDN paradigm can simplify the implementation, speed up incident responses, and, in general, allow to promptly react to cyber attacks through proper countermeasures. Nevertheless, embedding IDS within SDN also introduces delays that cannot be tolerated in specific network environments, like industrial control systems. This paper focuses on the implementation of an IDS based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms into an SDN architecture and proposes a very practical approach to reduce the delay by using the sequential implementation of prototypes of increasing software and hardware complexity so allowing quick tests to highlight the main problems, solve them and pass to the next operative step. A fully validated performance evaluation is then shown by exploiting all the presented solutions and by using further improved hardware features. The overall performance is very good and compliant with most, even if not yet all, industrial control systems constraints. Results show how the proposed solutions provide a significant improvement of the latency so opening the door to a real implementation in the field.

AB In this position paper, we tackle the following question: why anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS), despite providing excellent results and holding higher (potential) capabilities to detect unknown (zero-day) attacks, are still marginal in the industry, when compared to, e.g., signature-based IDS? We will try to answer this question by looking at the methods and criteria for comparing IDS as well as a specific problem with anomaly-based IDS. We will propose 3 new criteria for comparing IDS. Finally, we focus our discussion under the specific domain of IDS for critical Industrial control systems (ICS).

AB Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the brains of Industrial Control Systems (ICSes), and thus, are often targeted by attackers. While many intrusion detection systems (IDSes) have been adapted to monitor ICS, they cannot detect malicious network packets from a compromised PLC that conform to the network protocol. A domain expert needs to manually construct IDS rules to model a PLC's behavior. That approach is time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, machine learning can infer a PLC's behavior model from network traces, but that model may be inaccurate due to a lack of high-quality training data. This paper presents CoToRu - a toolchain that takes in the PLC's code to automatically generate a comprehensive set of IDS rules. CoToRu comprises (1) an analyzer that parses PLC code to build a state transition table for modeling the PLC's behavior, and (2) a generator that instantiates IDS rules for detecting deviations in PLC behavior. The generated rules can be imported into Zeek IDS to detect various attacks. We apply CoToRu to a power grid testbed and show that our generated rules provide superior performance compared to existing IDSes, including those based on statistical analysis, invariant-checking, and machine learning. Our prototype with CoToRu's generated rules provide sub-millisecond detection latency, even for complex PLC logic.

AB There exist several process-based anomaly detectors for Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Often such detectors are built using Machine learning (ML) algorithms that do not take explicit advantage of the design knowledge of the plant under control. Such detectors are considered as physics unaware. In this paper, we present the outcome of a series of experiments designed to explore the significance of design knowledge in improving the detection effectiveness of ML-based anomaly detectors. The experiments were conducted on an operational Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) plant by launching several coordinated attacks. Based on the observations we argue that detectors that use physics-informed ML algorithms can detect, and explain to plant operators, a wider range of anomalies when compared against their physics-unaware counterparts.

TI Flow-based intrusion detection algorithm for supervisory control and
   data acquisition systems: A real-time approach
SO IET CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS: THEORY & APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Intrusion detection in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems is integral because of the critical roles of these systems in industries. However, available approaches in the literature lack representative flow-based datasets and reliable real-time adaption and evaluation. A publicly available labelled dataset to support flow-based intrusion detection research specific to SCADA systems is presented. Cyberattacks were carried out against our SCADA system test bed to generate this flow-based dataset. Moreover, a flow-based intrusion detection system (IDS) is developed for SCADA systems using a deep learning algorithm. We used the dataset to develop this IDS model for real-time operations of SCADA systems to detect attacks momentarily after they happen. The results show empirical proof of the model's adequacy when deployed online to detect cyberattacks in real time.

AB The social and economic stability of a country is dependent on critical infrastructures (CIs) whose services range from financial to healthcare and power to transportation and communications. Most of these CIs are cyber-physical systems (CPSs), which integrate the network's computational and communication capabilities to facilitate the monitoring and controlling of physical processes. Such systems are vulnerable to damage due to natural disasters, physical incidents, or cyber-attacks impacting the CPS organizations managing complex industrial control systems and data acquisition systems. When these CPSs are exposed to systemic cyber risks and cascaded network failures, network administrators need to recover from the compromise under limited resources. This is formulated as an attacker-defender game model to emulate the decision-making process in choosing an appropriate attack/defence mechanism in response to cybersecurity incidents using game theory. To further improve the assumptions made in the pure game-theoretic model, we relax the constraints on the rationality of the players, monetary payoff, and completeness of information by incorporating learning in games using reinforcement learning technique and compute the expected payoff using linguistic fuzzy variables.

AB The integration of the IoT network with the Operational Technology (OT) network is increasing rapidly. However, this incorporation of IoT devices into the OT network makes the industrial control system vulnerable to various cyber threats. Hacking an IoT device at the network edge, an attacker can move laterally to compromise the main control server and manipulate the whole control system of the industrial infrastructure. In this paper, we have proposed an automated Micro-segmentation (MS) model based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to reduce the lateral movement of an attacker or malware. The proposed model generates the micro-segments based on network traffic and blocks the malicious traffic at each segment. We have taken UNSW-NBI5 and IoTID20 datasets for our experiments. Experimental results show that after generating micro-segments and separating the normal traffic, the model limits redundant links and blocks malicious traffic. Limiting the usage of redundant links reduces the lateral movement or spreading of malware. We also considered the deterministic epidemic model to analyze the device infection rate due to lateral movement or malware propagation.

AB The false data injection attack can tamper with the measurement information collected by the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, threat the security of state estimation. Therefore, the analysing methods and detection methods of false data injection attacks have important theoretical and practical significance for ensuring the safe operation of smart grids. This study uses the invertible automatic encoder to reduce the dimension of the original data and uses the long-short-term memory to detect false data injection attacks. This method overcomes the shortcomings of shallow algorithm and traditional machine learning algorithm for power big data training and avoiding the problems of gradient explosion and gradient disappearing during training. Finally, the authors perform a large number of experiments in the IEEE 118-node test system and the 300-node test system and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

   processing; machine learning; word2vec
AB Since cyber attacks such as cyberterrorism against Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) and cyber espionage against companies managing them have increased, the techniques to detect anomalies in early stages are required. To achieve the purpose, several studies have developed anomaly detection methods for ICSs. In particular, some techniques using packet flow regularity in industrial control networks have achieved high-accuracy detection of attacks disrupting the regularity, i.e. normal behaviour, of ICSs. However, these methods cannot identify scanning attacks employed in cyber espionage because the probing packets assimilate into a number of normal ones. For example, the malware called Havex is customised to clandestinely acquire information from targeting ICSs using general request packets. The techniques to detect such scanning attacks using widespread packets await further investigation. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine high performance methods to identify anomalies even if elaborate packets to avoid alert systems were employed for attacks against industrial control networks. In this paper, a novel detection model for anomalous packets concealing behind normal traffic in industrial control networks was proposed. For the proposal of the sophisticated detection method, we took particular note of packet flow regularity and employed the Markov-chain model to detect anomalies. Moreover, we regarded not only original packets but similar ones to them as normal packets to reduce false alerts because it was indicated that an anomaly detection model using the Markov-chain suffers from the ample false positives affected by a number of normal, irregular packets, namely noise. To calculate the similarity between packets based on the packet flow regularity, a vector representation tool called word2vec was employed. Whilst word2vec is utilised for the culculation of word similarity in natural language processing tasks, we applied the technique to packets in ICSs to calculate packet similarity. As a result, the Markov-chain with word2vec model identified scanning packets assimulating into normal packets in higher performance than the conventional Markov-chain model. In conclusion, employing both packet flow regularity and packet similarity in industrial control networks contributes to improving the performance of anomaly detection in ICSs.

AB Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are a part of a broader category of systems commonly known as Industrial Control Systems (ICS). These systems are primarily used to monitor and control various manufacturing and distribution processes, such as switches, pumps, or centrifuges. Since these devices perform relatively the same tasks throughout their lifetime, they likely have a fixed and predictable CPU load or usage for extended periods of time. Our work is primarily based on the premise that we are able to infer CPU load by remotely profiling the network traffic emitted by an ICS device and use that inference to detect potentially malicious modifications to the behavior of the ICS device. This is in stark contrast to traditional (e.g., signature and rule-based) and even other non-traditional (e.g., power fingerprinting and backplane traffic monitoring) intrusion detection mechanisms for ICS networks, since our approach does not require signature or rule updates, special access to ICS backplane devices, or additional software to be installed on the ICS device. In previous work, we have demonstrated that it is feasible to use network traffic and machine learning to remotely infer the typical task cycle periods (i.e., CPU load) for an ABB RTU560 (contains a built-in PLC), even on a lightly loaded network one hop away. We now extend this capability to inferring the presence of anomalous CPU load behavior by introducing a Stuxnet-type threat model (i.e., state-sponsored root-kit) to showcase our prototype's detection ability (i.e., the ability to discern normal baseline states from those introduced by a threat). The main benefits of this approach are that: (1) it requires no additional software to be installed on the ICS devices to communicate with the monitor node, (2) the tool is low maintenance, since there are no software updates or signatures to be continuously installed on each ICS device, and (3) the risk of a centralized network-based monitor node being compromised is lower than if it were host-based software on each ICS device due to a reduced attack surface. Our overall prototype tool implements a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be used to monitor and alert on a small-sized to medium-sized ICS network of IP-based RTUs or PLCs similar to the ABB RTU560.

AB World is talking about connecting everything to the internet. Electric grids are no exception, and are rather one of the first application areas of the proposal. This connection with the internet has raised concerns about the inherent supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, whose structure too is adapting with the upcoming needs. The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel "What-if" module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal. This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer and one data authentication layer for field devices. We eventually clarify why all the IDS being proposed worldwide shall benefit if these work in tandem amongst themselves and moreover in tandem with the proposed " What-if" module.

AB Smart grid is becoming more interconnected with external networks as a result of integrating IoT technologies, making its supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) vulnerable to serious cyberattacks. Therefore, early detection of suspicious activities is of utmost importance to safeguard SCADA systems. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are effective methods for developing intrusion detection systems. However, developing an efficient and reliable detection system for smart grids remains challenging: Most suggested ML-based intrusion detection methods are based on centralized learning, in which data is collected from smart meters and transferred to a central server for training. Transferring sensitive data adds another burden to safeguarding smart grids, since it may result in significant privacy breaches and data leaks in the event of attacking the central server. In contrast to centralized learning, federated learning (FL) offers data privacy protection. FL is an emerging cooperative learning that enables training between smart devices (clients) using local datasets which are kept on the clients' sides. The resilience of FL-based detection systems in real-world situations, however, has not yet been examined, as clients may encounter various assaults, resulting in their local datasets having more or fewer attacks than others participating in the learning process. Motivated by this concern, we propose a FL-based intrusion detection for SCADA systems where clients have different attacks. We examine the impact of having missing attacks in local datasets on the performance of FL-based classifier. The experimental findings demonstrate a significant performance degradation of the FL-based model. Asa remedy, we suggest a novel learning method - hybrid learning - that combines centralized and federated learning. The experimental results show that the hybrid learning classifier succeeds in identifying unseen attacks.

ID THREATS
AB The increase in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) solutions in industrial systems has made these systems more vulnerable to cyberattacks due to insecure communication protocols. This paper proposes a privacy-aware intrusion detection framework that reduces these risks. The proposed framework implements, through machine learning, anomaly detection methods, classification techniques and feature selection methodologies, integrating these approaches to optimize the identification of potential cyber threats, improve model accuracy, and enhance computational efficiency in SCADA systems. Anomaly detection is strengthened through Isolation Forests, time-series analysis, and Fourier-based burst detection while dynamically adapting to concept drift adaptation with Kullback-Leibler divergence. It also utilizes important feature optimization methods, implemented in multiple ways, such as SHAP, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Furthermore, the proposed framework includes a federated learning-based scheme that utilizes differential privacy and homomorphic encryption to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data to enhance model interpretability and efficiency with feature ranking to provide insights into attack patterns and anomaly characteristics. Defences against adversarial attacks use FGSM-based training, feature smoothing, and ensemble-based defences, to reduce susceptibility to evasion tactics. Honeypots and automated IP firewalls enhance attack profiling and proactive mitigation of incidents. The experimental results demonstrate the framework's operational capability and effectiveness for SCADA network security, achieving 99.29% accuracy, 94.8% recall and 4.1% false positive rates.

ID CYBER SECURITY
AB Cyber-security challenges are growing globally and are specifically targeting critical infrastructure. Conventional countermeasure practices are insufficient to provide proactive threat hunting. In this study, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost, and hybrid models were applied for proactive threat hunting. By automating detection, the hybrid machine learning-based method improves threat hunting and frees up time to concentrate on high-risk warnings. These models are implemented on approach devices, access, and principal servers. The efficacy of several models, including hybrid approaches, is assessed. The findings of these studies are that the AdaBoost model provides the highest efficiency, with a 0.98 ROC area and 95.7% accuracy, detecting 146 threats with 29 false positives. Similarly, the random forest model achieved a 0.98 area under the ROC curve and a 95% overall accuracy, accurately identifying 132 threats and reducing false positives to 31. The hybrid model exhibited promise with a 0.89 ROC area and 94.9% accuracy, though it requires further refinement to lower its false positive rate. This research emphasizes the role of machine learning in improving cyber-security, particularly for critical infrastructure. Advanced ML techniques enhance threat detection and response times, and their continuous learning ability ensures adaptability to new threats.

AB Data manipulation attacks targeting network traffic of SCADA systems may compromise the reliability of an Industrial Control system (ICS). This can mislead the control center about the real-time operating conditions of the ICS and can alter commands sent to the field equipment. Deep Learning techniques appear as a suitable solution for detecting such complicated attacks. This paper proposes a Network based Anomaly Detection System (NADS) to detect data manipulation attacks with a focus on Modbus/TCP-based SCADA systems. The proposed NADS is a sequence to sequence auto encoder which uses the long short term memory units with embedding layer, teacher forcing technique and attention mechanism. The model has been trained and tested using the SWaT dataset, which corresponds to a scaled-down water treatment plant. The model detected 23 of 36 attacks and outperformed two other existing NADS with an improvement of 0.22 for simple attacks and obtained a recall value of 0.86 on attack 36 compared to the other NADS which obtained 0.74.

AB Securing Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) can be challenging because security solutions intended for typical IT/OT systems may not be as effective in a CPS setting. The goal of this study is to create a mechanism for identifying and attributing two -level ensemble attacks that are specifically designed for use against Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). An original ensemble deep representation learning model is combined with decision tree algorithm to identify assaults on unbalanced ICS environments at the first level. An attack attribution network, which constitutes a collection of deep neural networks, is formed at the second level. The proposed model is tested using real -world datasets, notably those pertaining to water purification and gas pipelines. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms other strategies with comparable computing complexity and that the recommended model outperforms the existing mechanisms.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB In the Industry 4.0 era of smart grids, the real-world problem of blackouts and cascading failures due to cyberattacks is a significant concern and highly challenging because the existing Intrusion Detection System (IDS) falls behind in handling missing rates, response times, and detection accuracy. Addressing this problem with an early attack detection mechanism with a reduced missing rate and decreased response time is critical. The development of an Intelligent IDS is vital to the mission-critical infrastructure of a smart grid to prevent physical sabotage and processing downtime. This paper aims to develop a robust Anomaly-based IDS using a statistical approach with a machine learning classifier to discriminate cyberattacks from natural faults and man-made events to avoid blackouts and cascading failures. The novel mechanism of a statistical approach with a machine learning (SAML) classifier based on Neighborhood Component Analysis, ExtraTrees, and AdaBoost for feature extraction, bagging, and boosting, respectively, is proposed with optimal hyperparameter tuning for the early discrimination of cyberattacks from natural faults and man-made events. The proposed model is tested using the publicly available Industrial Control Systems Cyber Attack Power System (Triple Class) dataset with a three-bus/two-line transmission system from Mississippi State University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Furthermore, the proposed model is evaluated for scalability and generalization using the publicly accessible IEEE 14-bus and 57-bus system datasets of False Data Injection (FDI) attacks. The test results achieved higher detection accuracy, lower missing rates, decreased false alarm rates, and reduced response time compared to the existing approaches.

AB As the precursor of cyber-attacks, the campaigns of scanning groups are able to reflect the attack target and attack trend to a great extent, which provide highly valuable threat intelligence for cyber defenders to understand the current cyber security situation. However, how to identify scanning groups in the context of limited information, especially in the absence of relevant threat intelligence, remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we utilize the honeynet as the unique data source to propose a scanning group identification system, Scanner-Hunter, which focuses on identifying scanning groups targeting ICS devices. To better characterize scanning patterns, a novel traffic representation scheme for scanning traffic is proposed, which is composed of a set of feature vectors to describe all the ICS request packets. On this basis, we propose a novel self-expanding multi-class classification (SEMCC) model and the IP prefix judgment, which are deliberately integrated to cope with sophisticated scanning groups. Take the Modbus protocol as an example, we implement a prototype of Scanner-Hunter, and use six years of real-world honeynet datasets to evaluate its performance. The experimental results illustrate its effectiveness and superior performance compared with some popular machine learning methods and existing SOTA scanning group identification methods. In addition, Scanner-Hunter is further leveraged to investigate the group distribution and maliciousness of 506 unknown scanners, and some suspicious attack groups with APT characteristics are analyzed. Furthermore, accurate scanning group information will contribute to revealing potential attack organizations and supporting decision making to prevent or interrupt cyber-attacks in time.

AB Advanced cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure and the energy sector are becoming more common. With the invention of autonomous control systems (ACS) within advanced nuclear reactor designs, system designers, reactor operators, and regulators must consider cybersecurity during the design and operational phases. This article provides a cyber threat assessment of machine learning (ML)-based digital twinning (DT) technologies in the context of advanced reactor ACS. A cyber-physical testbed was created to emulate nuclear reactor digital instrumentation and controls (I&C) and act as a basis for the ACS. The ACS was designed as two plant-level DTs predicting reactor malfunctions and determining control actions and two component-level DTs responsible for classifying component states and forecasting component inputs and outputs (I/O). Two duplicate ACS designs- one using a traditional ML framework and one using an automated ML (AutoML) framework- were created and tested against cyber-attacks on training data, real-time process data, and ML model architectures to determine their respective qualitative cyber-risk in terms of likelihood and impact. Both frameworks showed similar cyber-resilience against training, real-time, and ML architecture attacks, proving that neither is inherently more secure. Recommended safeguard and security measures are posed to system designers, reactor operators, and regulators to maintain the cybersecurity of ML-based DT technologies such as ACS, prompting a holistic view of shared responsibility for maintaining cyber-secure ML-based systems.

AB The imbalance between normal and attack samples in the industrial control systems (ICSs) network environment leads to the low recognition rate of the intrusion detection model for a few abnormal samples when classifying. Since traditional machine learning methods can no longer meet the needs of increasingly complex networks, many researchers use deep learning to replace traditional machine learning methods. However, when a large amount of unbalanced data is used for training, the detection performance of deep learning decreases significantly. This paper proposes an intrusion detection method for industrial control systems based on a 1D CWGAN. The 1D CWGAN is a network attack sample generation method that combines 1D CNN and WGAN. Firstly, the problem of low ICS intrusion detection accuracy caused by a few types of attack samples is analyzed. This method balances the number of various attack samples in the data set from the aspect of data enhancement to improve detection accuracy. According to the temporal characteristics of network traffic, the algorithm uses 1D convolution and 1D transposed convolution to construct the modeling framework of network traffic data of two competing networks and uses gradient penalty instead of weight cutting in the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to generate virtual samples similar to real samples. After a large number of data sets are used for verification, the experimental results show that the method improves the classification performance of the CNN and BiSRU. For the CNN, after data balancing, the accuracy rate is increased by 0.75%, and the accuracy, recall rate and F1 are improved. Compared with the BiSRU without data processing, the accuracy of the s1D CWGAN-BiSRU is increased by 1.34%, and the accuracy, recall and F1 are increased by 7.2%, 3.46% and 5.29%.

AB Aiming at the imbalance of industrial control system data and the poor detection effect of industrial control intrusion detection systems on network attack traffic problems, we propose an ETM-TBD model based on hybrid machine learning and neural network models. Aiming at the problem of high dimensionality and imbalance in the amount of sample data in the massive data of industrial control systems, this paper proposes an IG-based feature selection method and an oversampling method for SMOTE. In the ETM-TBD model, we propose a hyperparameter optimization method based on Bayesian optimization used to optimize the parameters of the four basic machine learners in the model. By introducing a multi-head-attention mechanism, the Transformer module increases the attention between local features and global features, enabling the discovery of the internal relationship between features. Additionally, the BiGRU is used to preserve the temporal features of the dataset, while the DNN is used to extract deeper features. Finally, the SoftMax classifier is used to classify the output. By analyzing the results of the comparison and ablation experiments, it can be concluded that the F1-score of the ETM-TBD model on a robotic arm dataset is 0.9665 and the model has very low FNR and FPR scores of 0.0263 and 0.0081, respectively. It can be seen that the model in this paper is better than the traditional single machine learning algorithm as well as the algorithm lacking any of the modules.

AB Recently, the process control network (PCN) of oil and gas installation has been subjected to amorphous cyber-attacks. Examples include the denial-of-service (DoS), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and this may have largely been caused by the integration of open network to operation technology (OT) as a result of low-cost network expansion. The connection of OT to the internet for firmware updates, third-party support, or the intervention of vendors has exposed the industry to attacks. The inability to detect these unpredictable cyber-attacks exposes the PCN, and a successful attack can lead to devastating effects. This paper reviews the different forms of cyber-attacks in PCN of oil and gas installations while proposing the use of machine learning algorithms to monitor data exchanges between the sensors, controllers, processes, and the final control elements on the network to detect anomalies in such data exchanges. Python 3.0 Libraries, Deep-Learning Toolkit, MATLAB, and Allen Bradley RSLogic 5000 PLC Emulator software were used in simulating the process control. The outcomes of the experiments show the reliability and functionality of the different machine learning algorithms in detecting these anomalies with significant precise attack detections identified using tree algorithms (bagged or coarse ) for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks while taking note of accuracy-computation complexity trade-offs.

AB The protection of critical infrastructure such as water treatment and water distribution systems is crucial for a functioning economy. The use of cyber-physical systems in these systems presents numerous vulnerabilities to attackers. To enhance security, intrusion detection systems play a crucial role in limiting damage from successful attacks. Machine learning can enhance security by analysing data patterns, but several attributes of the data can negatively impact the performance of the machine learning model. Data in critical water system infrastructure can be difficult to work with due to their complexity, variability, irregularities, and sensitivity. The data involve various measurements and can vary over time due to changes in environmental conditions and operational changes. Irregular patterns and small changes can have significant impacts on analysis and decision making, requiring effective data preprocessing techniques to handle the complexities and ensure accurate analysis. This paper explores data preprocessing techniques using a water treatment system dataset as a case study and provides preprocessing techniques specific to processing data in industrial control to yield a more informative dataset. The results showed significant improvement in accuracy, F1 score, and time to detection when using the preprocessed dataset.

AB Cybersecurity is an ever-changing landscape. The threats of the future are hard to predict and even harder to prepare for. This paper presents work designed to prepare for the cybersecurity landscape of tomorrow by creating a key support capability for an autonomous cybersecurity testing system. This system is designed to test and prepare critical infrastructure for what the future of cyberattacks looks like. It proposes a new type of attack framework that provides precise and granular attack control and higher perception within a set of infected infrastructure. The proposed attack framework is intelligent, supports the fetching and execution of arbitrary attacks, and has a small memory and network footprint. This framework facilitates autonomous rapid penetration testing as well as the evaluation of where detection systems and procedures are underdeveloped and require further improvement in preparation for rapid autonomous cyber-attacks.

AB False alerts due to misconfigured or compromised intrusion detection systems (IDS) in industrial control system (ICS) networks can lead to severe economic and operational damage. However, research using deep learning to reduce false alerts often requires the physical and cyber sensor data to be trustworthy. Implicit trust is a major problem for artificial intelligence or machine learning (AI/ML) in cyber-physical system (CPS) security, because when these solutions are most urgently needed is also when they are most at risk (e.g., during an attack). To address this, the Inter-Domain Evidence theoretic Approach for Inference (IDEA-I) is proposed that reframes the detection problem as how to make good decisions given uncertainty. Specifically, an evidence theoretic approach leveraging Dempster-Shafer (DS) combination rules and their variants is proposed for reducing false alerts. A multi-hypothesis mass function model is designed that leverages probability scores obtained from supervised-learning classifiers. Using this model, a location-cum-domain-based fusion framework is proposed to evaluate the detector's performance using disjunctive, conjunctive, and cautious conjunctive rules. The approach is demonstrated in a cyber-physical power system testbed, and the classifiers are trained with datasets from Man-In-The-Middle attack emulation in a large-scale synthetic electric grid. For evaluating the performance, we consider plausibility, belief, pignistic, and general Bayesian theorem-based metrics as decision functions. To improve the performance, a multi-objective-based genetic algorithm is proposed for feature selection considering the decision metrics as the fitness function. Finally, we present a software application to evaluate the DS fusion approaches with different parameters and architectures.

AB The increasing interaction of industrial control systems (ICSs) with public networks and digital devices introduces new cyber threats to power systems and other critical infrastructure. Recent cyber-physical attacks such as Stuxnet and Irongate revealed unexpected ICS vulnerabilities and a need for improved security measures. Intrusion detection systems constitute a key security technology, which typically monitors cyber network data for detecting malicious activities. However, a central characteristic of modern ICSs is the increasing interdependency of physical and cyber network processes. Thus, the integration of network and physical process data is seen as a promising approach to improve predictability in real-time intrusion detection for ICSs by accounting for physical constraints and underlying process patterns. This work systematically assesses machine learning-based cyber-physical intrusion detection and multi-class classification through a comparison to its purely network data-based counterpart and evaluation of misclassifications and detection delay. Multiple supervised detection and classification pipelines are applied on a recent cyber-physical dataset, which describes various cyber attacks and physical faults on a generic ICS. A key finding is that the integration of physical process data improves detection and classification of all considered attack types. In addition, it enables simultaneous processing of attacks and faults, paving the way for holistic cross-domain root cause identification.

AB With an increasing number of adversarial attacks against Industrial Control Systems (ICS) networks, enhancing the security of such systems is invaluable. Although attack prevention strategies are often in place, protecting against all attacks, especially zero-day attacks, is becoming impossible. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are needed to detect such attacks promptly. Machine learning-based detection systems, especially deep learning algorithms, have shown promising results and outperformed other approaches. In this paper, we study the efficacy of a deep learning approach, namely, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), in detecting abnormal behaviors in ICS network traffic. We focus on very common reconnaissance attacks in ICS networks. In such attacks, the adversary focuses on gathering information about the targeted network. To evaluate our approach, we compare MLP with isolation Forest (iForest), a statistical machine learning approach. Our proposed deep learning approach achieves an accuracy of more than 99% while iForest achieves only 75%. This helps to reinforce the promise of using deep learning techniques for anomaly detection.

AB The confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical infrastructure is crucial for any economy to operate efficiently. Water distribution critical infrastructure is a target of many attackers who aim to penetrate the system for malicious reasons. The use of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in Water Distribution Systems unveils many vulnerabilities that attackers can use. Although preventative security mechanisms are put into place they too can be defeated, and in this case, a second layer of security is essential. Intrusion detection mechanisms are important reactive security mechanisms to limit the damage done by a successful attack in the system. In this paper machine learning (ML) techniques for anomaly detection (AD) are reviewed.

AB The security of Industrial Control Systems is of high importance as they play a critical role in uninterrupted services provided by Critical Infrastructure operators. Due to a large number of devices and their geographical distribution, Industrial Control Systems need efficient automatic cyber-attack detection and attribution methods, which suggests us AI-based approaches. This paper proposes a model called SteelEye based on SemiDeep Learning for accurate detection and attribution of cyber-attacks at the application layer in industrial control systems. The proposed model depends on Bag of Features for accurate detection of cyber-attacks and utilizes Categorical Boosting as the base predictor for attack attribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SteelEye remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art cyber-attack detection and attribution methods in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Cybersecurity has become an emerging challenge for business information management and critical infrastructure protection in recent years. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely used in different fields, but it is still relatively new in the area of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security. In this paper, we provide an approach based on Machine Learning (ML) to intelligent threat recognition to enable run-time risk assessment for superior situation awareness in CPS security monitoring. With the aim of classifying malicious activity, several machine learning methods, such as k-nearest neighbours (kNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF), have been applied and compared using using two different publicly available real-world testbeds. The results show that RF allowed for the best classification performance. When used in reference industrial applications, the approach allows security control room operators to get notified of threats only when classification confidence will be above a threshold, hence reducing the stress of security managers and effectively supporting their decisions.

AB With the deep integration of industrialization and informatization, the network environment is becoming more and more complex, and security is facing a huge threat. Recently, the industrial control systems pose an open trend, so the strategy of preventing external attacks through "physical isolation" does not work anymore. The security threats in the traditional IT field gradually affect the security of industrial control networks. Recently, more and more researchers apply artificial intelligence algorithms and blockchain technology to industrial control network security. This paper aims to propose a new way of thinking, starting from two levels of physical topology and time series structure for a specific industrial control system, establish a graph data structure, and then use the graph neural network (GNN) algorithm to detect abnormal nodes. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive experiments and the results are promising.

AB Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems monitor and control the critical infrastructures (CI) such as power generation, smart grids, oilgas pipelines, wastewater management, and nuclear power plant. Due to the drastic increase in cyber attacks, maintaining SCADA systems has become a complex task. Difficulty in securing the SCADA has gained the attention of researchers in designing a robust intrusion detection system (IDS). However, existing machine-learning and statistical approaches fail to detect the cyber physical attacks with high detection rate. This paper presents a sine-cosine optimization based recurrent neural network (SCO-RNN) to detect the cyber physical attacks against SCADA systems and the performance of the proposed SCO-RNN was validated using the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset in terms of accuracy and detection rate.

AB In this paper, the stealthy attack detection in industrial control system (ICS) is studied, and a new detection method is proposed from the perspective of signal analysis. The method consists of a double-layer one-class support vector machine model (DL-OCSVM), where the first-layer model is the standard OCSVM, and the second-layer model is obtained by incremental learning based on the former. The wavelet decomposition is used to extract the physical characteristics of the ICS. The KKT condition and the adjacent classification interval are adopted to reduce the training samples, improving the learning rate and system scalability. In addition, the designed boundary samples are employed for incremental learning, avoiding overfitting and reducing false positives rate (FPR). The experimental results show that the proposed method has high detection rate and low FPR for stealthy attacks, and is more suitable for precision machining process. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB With the rapid progression of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and especially of Internet of Things (IoT), the conventional electrical grid is transformed into a new intelligent paradigm, known as Smart Grid (SG). SG provides significant benefits both for utility companies and energy consumers such as the two-way communication (both electricity and information), distributed generation, remote monitoring, self-healing and pervasive control. However, at the same time, this dependence introduces new security challenges, since SG inherits the vulnerabilities of multiple heterogeneous, co-existing legacy and smart technologies, such as IoT and Industrial Control Systems (ICS). An effective countermeasure against the various cyberthreats in SG is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS), informing the operator timely about the possible cyberattacks and anomalies. In this paper, we provide an anomaly-based IDS especially designed for SG utilising operational data from a real power plant. In particular, many machine learning and deep learning models were deployed, introducing novel parameters and feature representations in a comparative study. The evaluation analysis demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed IDS and the improvement due to the suggested complex data representation.

AB The last decade has witnessed a paradigm change in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), from closed, isolated systems to fully-connected, Internet-capable systems. At the same time, new wireless technologies, mainly coming from the Internet of Things domain, emerged. IEEE 802.15.4 wireless-based standards like WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, ZigBee, and WIA-PA are increasingly used for monitoring industrial processes. Nevertheless, along with this paradigm change, some new threats appeared that menace current industrial infrastructures and economies (e.g., Stuxnet, Mariposa, Slammer). Additionally, in order to keep up with the requirements of new Industry 4.0 applications, sensor nodes software and hardware are becoming more complex and, thus, more prone to faults. In this paper, using a monitoring architecture proposed in our previous work, we injected and subsequently proceeded to detect representative firmware and hardware anomalies (namely, buffer overflow attacks, SPI faults, under-voltage, and high temperature faults) that can be used by attackers to cause major losses or even damage industrial control systems. We evaluated the performance of several machine learning techniques commonly used to detect anomalies (i.e. OCSVM, kNN, AutoEnconder), in order to determine if they could be useful to detect such faults. The obtained results demonstrate that simple and broad scope classifiers, using features that consume little resources, can be developed to detect such faults.

AB Cyber threats are nowadays a major danger to critical infrastructures and to homeland security. For several years now, the focus have been targeted at the physical protection of critical infrastructures. Currently, experts realize that the critical infrastructure can be also attacked via the application layer of computer networks. In order to efficiently protect such critical systems, the huge amount of data has to be efficiently analyzed and correlated. Therefore, this paper focuses on the overview of the advanced data stream processing methods to be applied in the domain of cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection. The major contribution of this work is the analysis of such innovative aspects as concept drift analysis deployed as the pre-processing step dedicated for anomaly detection systems to counter cyber attacks. Moreover, we discuss the different challenges in data streams analysis including data imbalance and provide solid reasoning why applying a concept drift detector is crucial when designing a modern cybersecurity systems.

ID SCADA SYSTEMS
AB In the course of industrial digitalization, the security of process control networks and especially critical infrastructures has become a major issue that requires novel methods to achieve a multi-level protection. An important feature of this protection is a protocol-specific monitoring within the process control networks that identifies faults and attacks which already have overcome the firewall protection. For a wide-spread application in various sites, this monitoring must be self-adaptive to the different traffic characteristics of the respective networks. Protocol knowledge combined with unsupervised machine learning algorithms can leverage this task. In this paper we present the latest results of applying two machine learning methods on real-world traffic datasets from two plant process control networks. The results for different mappings of the considered packet features are discussed in terms of f-score, precision, and recall. They demonstrate the high potential of using unsupervised learning for training anomaly detectors to identify intrusions in industrial networks.

AB The security of critical infrastructure such as Smart Grid is of significant concern because cyber-physical attacks are becoming a frequent occurrence. Cybercriminals compromise cyberinfrastructure to control physical processes maliciously. It is the system administrator's goal to find vulnerabilities in the smart grid functions and patch them before they are compromised. Unfortunately, limited resources and a large attack surface make it difficult to decide which function to protect in a particular system state. In this research paper, we tackle the problem of resource allocation in the smart grid system by proposing a tool, Reinforcement Learning-Bayesian Attack Graph for Smart Grid System (RL-BAGS), which provides functionality to the system engineers to compute optimal policies on regular intervals about whether to SCAN or PATCH a particular function of the smart grid system. RL-BAGS considers functions and network architecture of the system to generate a Bayesian Network, which represents the state of the system. RL-BAGS implements two reinforcement learning algorithms, Q-Learning and SARSA learning, on the generated Bayesian Network to learn optimal policies. RL-BAGS assists system administrators performing in-depth studies of one of the functions of the smart grid system advising effective actions to scan or patch a system component.

AB Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are the key driver for critical infrastructures and industrial facilities. Cyber-attacks to SCADA networks may cause equipment damage or even fatalities. Identifying risks in SCADA networks is critical to ensuring the normal operation of these industrial systems. In this paper we propose a Bayesian network based cyber-security risk assessment model to dynamically and quantitatively assess the security risk level in SCADA networks. The major distinction of our work is that the proposed risk assessment method can learn model parameters from historical data and then improve assessment accuracy by incrementally learning from online observations. Furthermore, our method is able to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for SCADA security risk assessment.

AB National assets such as transportation networks, large manufacturing, business and health facilities, power generation, and distribution networks are critical infrastructures. The cyber threats to these infrastructures have increasingly become more sophisticated, extensive and numerous. Cyber security conventional measures have proved useful in the past but increasing sophistication of attacks dictates the need for newer measures. The autonomic computing paradigm mimics the autonomic nervous system and is promising to meet the latest challenges in the cyber threat landscape. This paper provides a brief review of autonomic computing applications for SCADA systems and proposes architecture for cyber security.

AB Researchers have previously attempted to apply machine learning techniques to network anomaly detection problems. Due to the staggering amount of variety that can occur in normal networks, as well as the difficulty in capturing realistic data sets for supervised learning or testing, the results have often been underwhelming. These challenges are far less pronounced when considering industrial control system (ICS) networks. The recurrent nature of these networks results in less noise and more consistent patterns for a machine learning algorithm to recognize. We propose a method of evolving decision trees through genetic programming (GP) in order to detect network anomalies, such as device outages. Our approach extracts over a dozen features from network packet captures and netflows, normalizes them, and relates them in decision trees using fuzzy logic operators. We used the trees to detect three specific network events from three different points on the network across a statistically significant number of runs and achieved 100% accuracy on five of the nine experiments. When the trees attempted to detect more challenging events at points of presence further from the occurrence, the accuracy averaged to above 98%. On cases where the trees were many hops away and not enough information was available, the accuracy dipped to roughly 50%, or that of a random search. Using our method, all of the evolutionary cycles of the GP algorithm are computed alpha-priori, allowing the best resultant trees to be deployed as semi-real-time sensors with little overhead. In order for the trees to perform optimally, buffered packets and flows need to be ingested at twenty minute intervals.

AB The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly transformed Industrial Control Systems (ICS) by increasing their dependence on interconnected devices for automating processes. This growing integration of IoT technologies within ICS has heightened concerns about security and privacy, underscoring the importance of protecting sensitive data. This paper addresses the challenge of detecting anomalies within ICS environments that utilize the Modbus protocol. Modbus requests are encapsulated in Modbus frames, which direct devices on the specific actions to undertake. Thus, the sequence of Modbus frames in network traffic serves as a comprehensive indicator of device behavior on the network. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for anomaly detection by modeling device interactions on the network through the analysis of Modbus frame sequences using a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) framework, termed the ModbusNFA Behavior Distinguisher (MNBD) model. The NFA framework is particularly effective for this purpose as it can represent multiple potential states and transitions within a network, thereby capturing the complexity and variability of network behaviors. This capability allows the MNBD model to detect deviations from normal behavior, identifying potential anomalies with high accuracy. Our MNBD model was evaluated against several existing ICS network traffic datasets. The results demonstrate that the Modbus-NFA approach not only surpasses traditional machine learning models but also outperforms sequence-based deep learning models. Additionally, cross-dataset testing reveals that the MNBD model exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to deep learning-based approaches. These findings highlight the MNBD model's potential as a robust tool for anomaly detection, advancing research and development efforts in ICS security.

AB Current data on cybercrime shows a rising influence of online threats, leading to significant financial impacts across vital industries like finance, healthcare, and energy. These impacts encompass the theft of confidential information, service interruptions, and expenses tied to breach remediation, underscoring the urgent necessity for strengthened cybersecurity strategies. Machine learning (ML) is highly effective in signifying cybersecurity standards, leveraging large-scale data analysis, pattern recognition, and adaptability to emerging threats. Unlike other traditional methods such as rule-based that relay on predefined criteria. This study presents an automated ML framework to recommend cybersecurity standards, audits, and compliance measures, enhancing and monitoring cybersecurity infrastructure systematically. Nine cybersecurity standards, including seven international (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001:2022, NIST, CIS) and two national standards (UAE, KSA), were analyzed using data from official sources. Data preprocessing addressed duplicates and missing values, with validation via Pearson Correlation and Chi-square tests (Chi-square = 55.79, p = 0.0017). Attributes were extracted using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique and refined through Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). A content-based filtering (CBF) recommender system, aligned with organizational maturity levels, was developed and enhanced with a feedback loop for user insights. The recommendation model was validated across three organizational growth scenarios: ad-hoc, managed, and adaptive. The UAE standard recommended 158 controls for Scenario-1, while KSA led in Scenario-2. We evaluate the performance of the model using 3-ML classifiers including Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Model performance was assessed using the F1 score and ROC AUC score. Testing in ad-hoc, managed, and adaptive scenarios showed the UAE standard recommended 158 controls for Scenario-1, while KSA led Scenario-2. The RF classifier achieved 81% accuracy and an ROC AUC score of 0.98. This framework supports alignment with global standards, enhances cybersecurity governance, and enables ongoing cybersecurity maturity tracking, aiding resilience and improving GCI rankings.

AB By integrating advanced technologies and data-driven systems in smart grids, there has been a significant revolution in the energy distribution sector, bringing a new era of efficiency and sustainability. Nevertheless, with this advancement comes vulnerability, particularly in the form of cyber threats, which have the potential to damage critical infrastructure. False data injection attacks are among the threats to the cyber-physical layer of smart grids. False data injection attacks pose a significant risk, manipulating the data in the control system layer to compromise the grid's integrity. An early detection and mitigation of such cyberattacks are crucial to ensuring the smart grid operates securely and reliably. In this research paper, we demonstrate different machine learning classification models for detecting false data injection attacks, including the Extra Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Bagging Classifiers, to secure the integrity of smart grids. A comprehensive dataset of various attack scenarios provides insights to explore and develop effective detection models. Results show that the Extra Tree, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting models' accuracy in detecting the attack outperformed the existing literature, an achieving accuracy of 98%, 97%, and 97%, respectively.

AB The widespread adoption of computers and the Internet in recent decades has led to a growing reliance on digital technologies. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) applications are now used in various sectors such as nuclear power plants, oil and gas extraction, and refineries. However, ensuring the security of computer networks and such autonomous systems is essential to thwart potential threats from hackers and intruders. In this article, an intrusion detection scheme is proposed by deploying different machine learning algorithms (referred to as IDM-DNP3). These algorithms are rigorously trained and tested on an extensive dataset encompassing nine Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) testbed attacks. Utilizing a range of algorithms, a multi-class classification model was successfully developed for detecting attacks related to SCADA and DNP3. The comparative study conducted shows that IDM-DNP3 can detect potential threats with higher accuracy than other existing schemes.

AB In recent years, Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) have faced increasing vulnerability to cyber attacks due to their integration with the Internet. Despite efforts to enhance cybersecurity, reconnaissance attacks remain a significant threat, prompting the need for innovative defensive strategies. This paper introduces a novel approach to strengthen the defensive capabilities of ICS networks against reconnaissance attacks using machine learning-driven cyber deception techniques. Leveraging Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs), the proposed framework dynamically generates defensive network topologies to network shuffling and implement deception strategies, prioritizing system availability. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior efficacy of the proposed framework in enhancing cybersecurity while minimizing computational overhead. By effectively mitigating reconnaissance attacks, this solution reinforces the resilience of ICS networks, safeguarding critical industrial infrastructure from evolving cyber threats. These findings underscore the significance of adopting machine learning-based cyber deception as a pragmatic security measure for protecting ICS networks in real-world industrial contexts.

AB The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks pose significant threats to organizational entities and critical national infrastructure, leading to substantial financial and operational consequences. Detecting such attacks early and accurately remains a complex endeavour, compounded by challenges in intrusion detection system (IDS) design, the exploitation of zero-day attacks, and issues of reliability and resiliency in physical systems. This research addresses these challenges through a two-fold approach: firstly, implementing input data fusion from diverse and heterogeneous sources, and secondly, fusing classifiers from multiple deep learning (DL)-based algorithms. The success of machine learning (ML) and DL models for IDS relies on meticulous data collection and classifier selection. The paper underscores the limitations of relying on single datasets and ML/DL algorithms, emphasizing potential biases and training restrictions. Rigorous experiments were conducted to identify optimal DL architectures, ensuring the creation of models that exhibit robust generalization on new traffic instances, leading to trusted and unbiased results. The study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed models through comprehensive evaluations and metrics. Results indicate that the fusion of data and classifiers significantly improves model generalization. The paper also outlines key challenges and future trends in data fusion, emphasizing its role in enhancing IDS performance for securing critical infrastructure.

AB The demand for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) has recently increased in various domains, such as smart grids, intelligent transportation, and critical infrastructure. The massive data networks and communication layers generated make CPSs vulnerable to threats and cyberattacks. To mitigate these threats, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are employed. However, AI models struggle to keep up with the constantly changing attack landscape. This study investigates the application of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) AI models for cyberattack detection in a CPS. Accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score validate the approach as evaluation metrics. The methods were tested on a gas pipeline industrial control system dataset and other benchmark datasets, such as NetML-2020 and IoT-23, which contain various cyberattacks. The performance of the two methods was found to be better than other models such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) on several evaluation metrics. Finally, we present recommendations for future research.

AB Industrial control systems (ICSs) are becoming increasingly interconnected as the rapid convergence of information technology (IT) and operation technology (OT) networks, and meanwhile massive attack surfaces have been exposed. However, traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are difficult to be directly deployed in ICSs due to the hard real-time requirement and rare patching chance. Besides, the design of effective and practical IDSs is hampered by the lack of benchmarking ICS cybersecurity datasets. To bridge the gaps, this paper makes the first attempt by open-sourcing the developed ICS cybersecurity datasets and proposing a decision fusion based real-time IDS. Firstly, we design a customized cybersecurity dataset in a full-hardware and high-fidelity platform, including 7 types of cyber threats tailored for ICSs. The collected dataset includes network traffic, sensor readings, actuator status, and system parameters, providing the state-of-the-art benchmark dataset for ICSs consisting of cross-layer characteristics. Furthermore, we design an online decision fusion-based IDS by strategically integrating 4 widely-used machine learning models. The proposed IDS is deployed on a real-time running ethanol distillation, surpassing the performance of single detection models in terms of precision and F1-score, which substantially enhances intrusion detection accuracy and cybersecurity of ICS.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Since supervised learning intrusion detection models rely on manually labeled data, the process often requires a lot of time and effort. To make full use of unlabeled network traffic data and improve intrusion detection, this paper proposes an intrusion detection method for industrial control systems based on improved comparative learning SimCLR. Firstly, a feature extraction network is trained on SimCLR using unlabeled data; a linear classification layer is added to the trained feature extraction network model; and a small amount of labeled data is used for supervised training and fine-tuning of the model parameters. The trained model is simulated on the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset and the publicly available industrial control dataset from Mississippi State University, and the results show that the method has better results in all evaluation metrics compared with the deep learning algorithm using supervised learning directly, and the comparative learning has research value in industrial control system intrusion detection.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB In recent times, Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) have been extensively deployed in vital infrastructures to provide crucial services to society. In the smart factory scenario, the Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are CPSs that autonomously regulate the manufacturing process through sensors and actuators. Protection of these industrial control systems against cyber threats is essential to prevent any malfunction in the production procedure. In this article, a Fuzzy Controller-enabled Autoencoder Framework (FCAF) is proposed. The proposed framework can detect anomalies that may arise due to cyberattacks in the smart factory environment. The results show evidence that the model can sense any rapid deviation from normal behaviour once the attack commences and also detects unforeseen anomalies. The model further reduces the bias arising from the machine learning algorithm by introducing a fuzzy controller. The highest specificity and sensitivity reported by the proposed technique are 93% and 49.9%, respectively.

AB Energy distribution systems and cyber-physical systems brought together information technology, electrical and mechanical engineering in an integrated manner. This cybernetic-mechatronics development has drawn the attention of both cybercriminals and cybersecurity researchers by expanding the attacks in critical infrastructures. With the development of information communication technology, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems will turn into cloud-based systems that can communicate with IoT devices in the future. In addition, SCADA systems can be utilized in hospitals for various aspects and in IoT healthcare environments. However, SCADA protocols communicate on text and do not have a generalized security structure. Intrusion detection systems are structures developed against cyber-attacks that may cause serious damage. These systems try to provide the highest level of security, including both software and hardware structures. In this work, attack detection based on artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques is performed for the classification of attack threats in cyber-physical systems. Intrusion detection based on artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques is performed for the detection and classification of threats against cyber-physical systems. In this context, attack type classification is performed using machine learning algorithms. At the same time, performance evaluation realized by using computational metrics on machine learning algorithms. Attack type determination and performance analysis were carried out in the test environment and the results were discussed.

AB Industrial control systems (ICS) are facing increasing cybersecurity issues, leading to enormous threats and risks to numerous industrial infrastructures. In order to resist such threats and risks, it is particularly important to scientifically construct security strategies before an attack occurs. The characteristics of evolutionary algorithms are very suitable for finding optimal strategies. However, the more common evolutionary algorithms currently used have relatively large limitations in convergence accuracy and convergence speed, such as PSO, DE, GA, etc. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid strategy differential evolution algorithm based on reinforcement learning and opposition-based learning to construct the optimal security strategy. It greatly improved the common problems of evolutionary algorithms. This paper first scans the vulnerabilities of the water distribution system and generates an attack graph. Then, in order to solve the balance problem of cost and benefit, a cost-benefit-based objective function is constructed. Finally, the optimal security strategy set is constructed using the algorithm proposed in this paper. Through experiments, it is found that in the problem of security strategy construction, the algorithm in this paper has obvious advantages in convergence speed and convergence accuracy compared with some other intelligent strategy selection algorithms.

TI Dimension Reduction Technique Based on Supervised Autoencoder for
   Intrusion Detection of Industrial Control Systems
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS

DT Article
ID PCA; SVM
AB Industrial control systems (ICSs) are closely related to human life. In recent years, many ICSs have been connected to the Internet rather than being physically isolated, which has improved business efficiency while also increasing the risks of being attacked. The security issues of ICSs have gotten a lot of interest in the research community because attack events that aim at ICSs can cause catastrophic damage. An intrusion detection system (IDS) serves as an important tool for providing protection. Many IDS studies using machine learning and deep learning have been proposed. However, high-dimensional data may cause overfitting, resulting in inferior performance. To improve the classification performance, we suggest a dimension reduction technique based on the supervised autoencoder (SupervisedAE) and principal components analysis (PCA) in this study. To obtain more discriminative latent representations, compared with the conventional autoencoder, the SupervisedAE absorbs the label information during the training process. In this way, the improved autoencoder model is trained with reconstruction error and classification error simultaneously. Based on the latent representations extracted from the SupervisedAE, we add the PCA algorithm. The additional PCA algorithm reduces the dimension of features further. We conduct a series of experiments utilizing the suggested technique on a public power system data set to evaluate the performance. Compared with various dimension reduction methods, including autoencoder variants, the technique proposed in this study shows higher performance. In the meanwhile, it outperforms some existing detection methods in terms of accuracy and F1 score.

AB This paper proposes and analyses a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based anomaly detection framework for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT security has become a massive concern in recent years. IoT devices form the backbone of much of the critical infrastructure we have today. From power stations to biomedical devices, there is the potential of heavy financial damage and loss of human life if they become compromised. As IoT adoption accelerates, the amount of cyberattacks on IoT devices increases substantially. Due to the resource constrained nature of IoT devices, no security solution addresses all concerns in the IoT field. By training models based on normal power consumption behaviour, a wide range of anomalies can be detected in the power time series data of the IoT device. The methodology proposed in this paper is generic in nature, making it applicable to every IoT device on the market. The work in this paper is implemented at the edge, on an ultra-low-power microcontroller.

AB SCADA was designed to be used in an isolated area however, in modern SCADA, its connection to the Internet has become essential due to performance and commercial needs. This extended SCADA interconnection creates new vulnerabilities in the SCADA network. One of the attacks that may occur caused by the extended interconnection of SCADA networks to heterogeneous networks is Denial of Service attacks (DoS). DoS attack is launched by sending many messages from nodes. The development of easily accessible and simple DoS tools has increased the frequency of attacks. Ease of access and use of DoS tools made reduced the level of expertise needed to launch an attack. This study uses a SCADA dataset containing DoS attacks and running IEC 60870-5-104 protocol where this protocol will be encapsulated into TCP/IP protocol before being transmitted so that the treatment in detecting DoS attack in SCADA networks using the IEC 104 protocol is not much different from a traditional computer network. This study implements three machine learning approaches, i.e.: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian Naive Bayes in creating an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) model to recognize DoS attack on the SCADA Network. Experimental results show that the performance of the Decision Tree approach has the best performance detection on the Testing dataset and Training dataset with an accuracy of 99.99% in all experiments.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB In the last few decades, as industrial control systems (ICSs) became more interconnected via modern networking techniques, there has been a growing need for new security and monitoring techniques to protect these systems. Advanced cyber-attacks on industrial systems take multiple steps to reach ICS end devices. However, current anomaly detection systems can only detect attacks on individual local devices, and they do not consider the impact or consequences of an individual attack on the rest of the ICS devices. In this paper, we aim to explore how deep learning recurrent neural networks and correlation analysis techniques can be used collaboratively for anomaly detection in an ICS network on the scale of the entire systems. For each detected attack, our presented system-wide anomaly detection method will predict the next step of the attack. We use iTrustSWaT dataset and Power System Attack datasets from MSU national Labs to explore how the addition of correlation analysis to recurrent networks can expand anomaly detection methods to the system-wide scale.

AB In this work we present a pattern classification approach coupling the Neighbourhood Component Analysis (NCA) classifier with the Canonical Differential Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (C-DEEPSO). The standard NCA uses the conjugate gradient method to minimize the classification error. Here we propose an approach using the C-DEEPSO instead. In the experimental design, the coupled approach is applied to 20 benchmark data sets, and its performance is compared with the standard NCA using the conjugate gradient. The experimental analysis shows the usage of an evolutionary approach to enhance the performance of a machine learning algorithm can be competitive when compared to well-known iterative optimization techniques, and even outperform them in some problems. A real-world problem classifying cyber-attacks to an industrial control system of gas pipelines is also solved by the proposed approach. The results obtained indicate the proposed approach can successfully identify possible cyber-attacks to the control system. In this way, the NCA coupled to C-DEEPSO can work as an Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), being able to guarantee an acceptable security level.

AB Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are promoting the connection of millions of devices, that once were seen as unconnectable, into a huge network, to be used in a large number of applications, from autonomous vehicles to industrial control systems, passing through building automation systems. These paradigm rely on the adoption of Cyber Physical Systems complemented with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and artificial intelligence techniques. These type of systems are responsible for collecting, processing and exchanging a vast amount of data, and for that reason, it is imperative to assure data integrity and protection against malicious modifications and attacks to ensure a safe and reliable operation. Data thefts and cyber attacks in general represent a significant danger, however, cyber attacks on IoT systems can be specially critical due to their proximity with humans, enhancing the risk of physical damage. This paper highlights the importance of securing these systems, pursuing a safer operation, having in mind the amount of security vulnerabilities found in embedded devices. For this purpose, this article studies possible security threats and weakness in two case studies coming from different IoT domains, i.e. building automation and factory automation, while seeking for solutions to improve these systems' security.

DE ICS security; Disabling reassembly attack; Deep learning; DNP3
AB As more sophisticated cyberattacks against industrial control systems (ICSs) such as crashoverride and TRITON occur frequently, the security of ICS is becoming more and more emphasized. Currently, many security researches have been conducted on ICSs, but most studies focus on messages at the application layer containing data, and the transport layer for data transmission is not considered. However, problems at the transport layer can interfere with normal data acquisition and cause problems in availability which is a key characteristic of the control system. In addition, attacks that exploit this point do not require detailed knowledge of the control system, which may result in fatal results with a lower level of difficulty than other attacks, so security of the transport layer should also be considered as an important factor. Therefore, in this paper, we 1)analyze the transport layer attack that interferes with data acquisition and the protocols that attacks are effective by analyzing from an attacker's perspective, 2) analyzed transport layer attacks in the DNP3 protocol widely used in ICSs, 3) in order to detect this, propose a many to one bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) based detection technique considering the characteristics of ICS, and 4) describe the verification of the proposed model through an actual substation's DNP3 packet.

AB Modern Industrial Control Systems (ICS) represent a wide variety of networked infrastructure connected to physical world. Depending on the application, these control systems are termed as Process Control Systems (PCS), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control Systems (DCS) or Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). ICS are designed for reliability; but security especially against cyber threats, is also a critical need. In particular, an intruder can inject false data to disrupt the system operation. Existing approaches are not satisfactory as novel attacks against critical industries are frequently identified. Despite significant effort and progress, attacks continue to evolve. Anomaly-based detection approaches are used to detect attacks that features the injection of spurious measurement data and proven to be efficient. In this paper, we develop injection attack detection system that uses deep learning algorithms such as stacked auto encoders and deep belief networks that are tailored to identify different types of injection attacks. A model plant is used to obtain different data such as sensor and actuator measurements and specific attacks were injected into the data. The injected attacks vary in behaviour for training and testing of the proposed schema. Performance metrics to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed anomaly detection approach is presented.

AB Today, with the digitization of manufacturing, industries are becoming more and more competitive and offer personalized products and services. With The Industry of the Future also known as Industry 4.0 or Fourth Industrial Revolution, architecture has fundamentally changed. It is based on intelligent automation and integrates a new technologies that allow permanent communication between machines and systems to ensure an increasing improvement in production.
   yDespite the advantages of industry 4.0, there are also challenges to be addressed: Network security has become very important than before, therefore we have to guarantee better intrusion detection, based on machine learning algorithms. To this end, we examine four supervised learning methods, namely: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Trees J48 and Random Forest, and compare the results using different performance measures (accuracy, recall, time to build the model etc). The data set used in this study comes from a laboratory scale gas pipeline, entitled "10% Random Sample Gas Pipeline". The objective of this research is to select the best algorithm to detect and predict attacks in SCADA Network, in order to take preventive measures against the risk of intrusion.

ID ATTACKS
AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks are widely deployed in modern industrial control systems (ICSs) such as energy-delivery systems. As an increasing number of field devices and computing nodes get interconnected, network-based cyber attacks have become major cyber threats to ICS network infrastructure. Field devices and computing nodes in ICSs are subjected to both conventional network attacks and specialized attacks purposely crafted for SCADA network protocols. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based network intrusion detection system for SCADA networks to protect ICSs from both conventional and SCADA specific network-based attacks. Instead of relying on hand-crafted features for individual network packets or flows, our proposed approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to characterize salient temporal patterns of SCADA traffic and identify time windows where network attacks are present. In addition, we design a re-training scheme to handle previously unseen network attack instances, enabling SCADA system operators to extend our neural network models with site-specific network attack traces. Our results using realistic SCADA traffic data sets show that the proposed deep-learning-based approach is well-suited for network intrusion detection in SCADA systems, achieving high detection accuracy and providing the capability to handle newly emerged threats.

AB Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are the critical infrastructures of power grids. It is very important to monitor and control industrial equipment through the networks. Most ICSs currently used in smart grid contain IT key equipment and communication technologies to implement the communication and logic control functions. However, unlike traditional IT network traffic, these power-related industrial control systems have variety of proprietary protocols. Obviously, in typical complex systems the manually intensive processing of data is costly and sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose an novel traffic anomaly detection model for power ICS based on Multi-Head attention (MHA) method, in which the collected raw traffic was converted into the form of matrix. The MHA and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model were used to classify traffic data. We replace the traditional feature extraction and rule making process with an acceptable computational cost. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by experiments on two real world power ICS testbeds: a power generation simulation platform based on a distributed control system (DCS) and a substation slave station. Comparing with some classical machine learning algorithms and Convolutional Neural Networks, the experimental results show that our MHA model outperforms the CNN-based and classical machine learning detection models with an accuracy rate of 99.86%.

AB The increasing digitization and connectivity of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have exposed them to highly sophisticated cyber threats to a great extent. Traditional security mechanisms like rule-based and signature-based intrusion detection systems fail to detect new and emerging attacks. In such limitations, the current research is on the Randomized Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) model for cyber-attack detection in ICS networks. The proposed model leverages convolutional layers to improve feature extraction and reduce the likelihood of overfitting. Additionally, advanced data preprocessing, augmentation, and hyperparameter optimization methods to maximize classification performance. With the increasing frequency of cybersecurity attacks in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), addressing such challenges are hindered by outdated public datasets and scarcity of testbeds, to design appropriate solutions to detect and prevent cyberattacks. To overcome this limitation, we have developed an in-house cyber testbed based on standard industrial operations, simulated with hacking scenarios. The model is trained and tuned with ICS cyber-attack benchmark datasets on the various attacks. Randomized layers provide controlled variability at training time, enhancing the model to recognize known and unknown attacks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed R-CNN method performs better than the baseline machine learning and conventional CNN methods with a detection accuracy of 98.7%. The model also achieves 98.2% precision, 97.9% recall, and an F1-score of 98.0%, making the threat detection robust and the false positive rate imperceptible. The computational overhead of the architecture also enables real-time deployment within an industrial setup. The improved Randomized CNN-based IDS in deep learning-based cyber security applications facilitates real-time cyber threat detection feasibility within ICS. It enhances the model for zero-day attack detection and integration with adaptive security paradigms for predictive threat blocking.

AB Given the escalating diversity, sophistication, and frequency of cyber attacks, it is imperative for critical infrastructure entities, e.g. smart grids, to recognize the inherent risks of operating in isolation. Sharing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) helps them stand together and build a collective cyber defense by knowledge, skills, and experience encompassing information related to identifying and evaluating cyber and physical threats. The present studies lack on robust CTI sharing strategies in smart grid systems. To address the critical need for secure and effective CTI sharing in smart grid systems, this article proposes a novel approach. Our solution leverages encrypted federated learning (FL) with integrated malicious client detection mechanisms. This approach facilitates collaborative learning of a threat detection model while preserving the privacy of raw CTI data. Employing real-world, heterogeneous smart grid datasets, we rigorously evaluated our approach under two distinct attack scenarios. The results demonstrate resilience against both man-in-the-middle attacks and malicious clients, exceeding the performance typically observed in traditional FL models.

AB Securing Industrial Control Systems (ICS) against cyber threats is crucial for maintaining operational reliability and safety in critical infrastructure. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) approaches in ICS development require substantial domain expertise, posing challenges for non-experts. To address this gap, we propose and evaluate ICS-defender, a defense mechanism to enhance ICS security through Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) techniques. Our approach leverages sophisticated feature engineering and AutoML to automate model selection, training, aggregation, and optimization, thereby reducing the dependency on specialized knowledge. We evaluate ICS-defender against state-of-the-art AutoML frameworks using diverse datasets from power systems and electric vehicle chargers. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that ICS-defender outperforms existing frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness, achieving average accuracies of 93.75%, 94.34%, and 87.12% for power systems attacks datasets and 94.23% for the electric vehicle charging station attacks dataset, surpassing baseline algorithms. This research contributes to advancing secure and resilient ICS, offering significant implications for broader applications and future enhancements in industrial cybersecurity.

AB Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) have faced a significant increase in malware threats since their integration with the Internet. However, existing machine learning-based malware identification methods are not specifically optimized for ICS environments, resulting in suboptimal identification performance. In this work, we propose an innovative method explicitly tailored for ICSs to enhance the performance of malware classifiers within these systems. Our method integrates the opcode2vec method based on preprocessed features with a conditional variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network, enabling classifiers based on Convolutional Neural Networks to identify malware more effectively and with some degree of increased stability and robustness. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our method, demonstrating the improved performance of malware classifiers in ICSs. Our method achieved an accuracy of 97.30%, precision of 92.34%, recall of 97.44%, and F1-score of 94.82%, which are the highest reported values in the experiment.

AB Urban water systems worldwide are confronted with the dual challenges of dwindling water resources and deteriorating infrastructure, emphasising the critical need to minimise water losses from leakage. Conventional methods for leak and burst detection often prove inadequate, leading to prolonged leak durations and heightened maintenance costs. This study investigates the efficacy of logic- and machine learning-based approaches in early leak detection and precise location identification within water distribution networks. By integrating hardware and software technologies, including sensor technology, data analysis, and study on the logic-based and machine learning algorithms, innovative solutions are proposed to optimise water distribution efficiency and minimise losses. In this research, we focus on a case study area in the Sunbury region of Victoria, Australia, evaluating a pumping main equipped with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) sensor technology. We extract hydraulic characteristics from SCADA data and develop logic-based algorithms for leak and burst detection, alongside state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. These methodologies are applied to historical data initially and will be subsequently extended to live data, enabling the real-time detection of leaks and bursts. The findings underscore the complementary nature of logic-based and machine learning approaches. While logic-based algorithms excel in capturing straightforward anomalies based on predefined conditions, they may struggle with complex or evolving patterns. Machine learning algorithms enhance detection by learning from historical data, adapting to changing conditions, and capturing intricate patterns and outliers. The comparative analysis of machine learning models highlights the superiority of the local outlier factor (LOF) in anomaly detection, leading to its selection as the final model. Furthermore, a web-based platform has been developed for leak and burst detection using a selected machine learning model. The success of machine learning models over traditional logic-based approaches underscores the effectiveness of data-driven, probabilistic methods in handling complex data patterns and variations. Leveraging statistical and probabilistic techniques, machine learning models offer adaptability and superior performance in scenarios with intricate or dynamic relationships between variables. The findings demonstrate that the proposed methodology can significantly enhance the early detection of leaks and bursts, thereby minimising water loss and associated economic costs. The implications of this study are profound for the scientific community and stakeholders, as it provides a scalable and efficient solution for water pipeline monitoring. Implementing this approach can lead to more proactive maintenance strategies, ultimately contributing to the sustainability and resilience of urban water infrastructure systems.

AB Global interest in advanced reactors has been reignited by recent investments in small modular reactors and micro-reactor design. The use of digital devices is essential for meeting the size and modularity requirements of small modular reactor controls. By fully digitizing the small modular reactor control systems, critical information can be obtained to optimize control, reduce costs, and extend the reactor ' s lifetime. However, the potential for cyber-attacks on digital devices leaves digital control systems vulnerable. To address this risk, this study presents a novel wavy-attention network for sensor attack detection in nuclear plants. The wavy-attention network comprises stacks of batch-normalized, dilated, one-dimensional convolution neural networks, and sequential selfattention modules, superior to conventional single-layer networks on sequence classification tasks. To evaluate the proposed wavy-attention network architecture, the International Atomic Energy Agency ' s Asherah Nuclear Simulator and a false data injection toolbox found in the literature, both implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK, are utilized. This approach leverages changes in process measurements to identify and classify cyber-attacks on priority signals using the proposed wavy-attention network. Three false data injection attacks are simulated on the simulator ' s pressure, temperature, and level sensors to obtain representative process measurements. The wavy-attention network is trained and validated with normal and compromised process variables obtained from the simulator. The performance of the wavy-attention network to discriminate between the reactor states using the test set shows 99% accuracy, as opposed to other baseline models such as vanilla convolution neural networks, long short -term memory networks, and bi-directional long short -term memory networks with 90%, 77%, and 91% accuracy, respectively. An ablation study is also conducted to test the contribution of each component of the proposed architecture. The theoretical framework of the proposed wavy-attention network and its implementation for nuclear reactor digital sensor attack detection are discussed in this paper.

AB Supervisory control and data acquisition systems are critical in Industry 4.0 for controlling and monitoring industrial processes. However, these systems are vulnerable to various attacks, and therefore, intelligent and robust intrusion detection systems as security tools are necessary for ensuring security. Machine learning-based intrusion detection systems require datasets with balanced class distribution, but in practice, imbalanced class distribution is unavoidable. A dataset created by running a supervisory control and data acquisition IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC 104) protocol on a testbed network is presented. The dataset includes normal and attacks traffic data such as port scan, brute force, and Denial of service attacks. Various types of Denial of service attacks are generated to create a robust and specific dataset for training the intrusion detection system model. Three popular techniques for handling class imbalance, that is, random over-sampling, random under-sampling, and synthetic minority oversampling, are implemented to select the best dataset for the experiment. Gradient boosting, decision tree, and random forest algorithms are used as classifiers for the intrusion detection system models. Experimental results indicate that the intrusion detection system model using decision tree and random forest classifiers using random under-sampling achieved the highest accuracy of 99.05%. The intrusion detection system model's performance is verified using various metrics such as recall, precision, F1-Score, receiver operating characteristics curves, and area under the curve. Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation shows no indication of overfitting in the created intrusion detection system model.
   Machine learning-based IDSs require datasets with balanced class distribution, but in practice, imbalanced class distribution is unavoidable. A dataset created by running a SCADA IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC 104) protocol on a testbed network is presented. The dataset includes normal and attack traffic data such as port scan, brute force, and Denial of service (DoS) attacks. Various types of DoS attacks are generated to create a robust and specific dataset for training the IDS model.image

AB Modern technologies adopt Internet of Things (IoT) devices to increase water management efficiency and enhance water quality services. However, the limitations of IoT devices, such as small sizes and poor security, weaken the Water Distribution System (WDS) security, and many attackers compromise the critical components of WDS. Cyber-physical attacks (CPAs) are considered one of the biggest challenges that decrease the security factors in WDS by disrupting normal operations and tampering with the critical data of the water system. For instance, an attacker can change the water pump's speed, disrupting the service. An attacker can also alter the data of water quality parameters to contaminate the water. It is important to propose solutions to increase security in the WDS and defend against CPAs and security threats. Although several intrusion detection methods were proposed in the literature to detect WDS CPAs, many issues still need solutions, such as detecting attacks with smaller false alarms, minimizing the time to disclose the attacks, determining the location of the compromising components, and recovering solutions for the attacked components. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on a deep learning algorithm called a Conditional variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to disclose CPAs and mitigate their bad effects on WDS. The proposed method consists of a neural network, an encoder to compress data, and a decoder to decompress data. The objective goal is to minimize the reconstruction error between the encoded-decoded data and the initial data. We apply the CVAE on some well-known datasets. The experiment results show that our proposed CVAE method performs better than others. After analyzing the CVAE model with other existing models, we get the highest performance by reaching %98 accuracy.

AB In recent years, there has been a notable surge in both the complexity and volume of targeted cyber attacks, largely due to heightened vulnerabilities in widely adopted technologies. The Prediction and detection of early attacks are vital to mitigating potential risks from cyber attacks and network resilience. With the rapid increase of digital data and the increasing complexity of cyber attacks, big data has become a crucial tool for intrusion detection and forecasting. By leveraging the capabilities of unstructured big data, intrusion detection and forecasting systems can become more effective in detecting and preventing cyber attacks and anomalies. While some progress has been made on attack prediction, little attention has been given to forecasting cyber events based on time series and unstructured big data. In this research, we used the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset, a comprehensive dataset containing several attacks on a realistic network. Then we used time-series forecasting techniques to construct time-series models with tuned parameters to assess the effectiveness of these techniques, which include Sequential Minimal Optimisation for regression (SMOreg), linear regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to forecast the cyber events. We used machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and random forest to evaluate the performance of the models. The best performance results of 90.4% were achieved with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and random forest. Additionally, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics were used to evaluate forecasted event performance. SMOreg's forecasted events yielded the lowest MAE, while those from linear regression exhibited the lowest RMSE. This work is anticipated to contribute to effective cyber threat detection, aiming to reduce security breaches within critical infrastructure.

AB As the leading mobile operating system, Android powers critical infrastructure and personal devices across sectors such as finance and healthcare and a wide range of user scenarios. However, its open-source nature presents considerable security challenges. Exploiting vulnerabilities in native and custom permissions, malicious API calls, intents, signatures, and manifests, threat actors can gain access to sensitive data and device control. The continuously evolving landscape of Android malware necessitates robust and generalized detection methods. While traditional machine learning (ML) models have been employed to address this issue, they have limitations. Focusing on single datasets can impede both generalization and effective detection. Further, the dynamic nature of malware renders many traditional methods inadequate for providing comprehensive and real-time protection. This paper addresses this critical need by proposing DeepImageDroid, an advanced and efficient deep learning (DL) framework for Android malware detection. DeepImageDroid harnesses the combined power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), utilizing three diverse Android malware datasets. This hybrid approach significantly improves detection accuracy and model generalization compared to existing solutions. By employing the weighted average ensemble method, DeepImageDroid achieved a remarkable 96% accuracy.

AB Industrial control systems (ICS) are vital for ensuring the reliability and operational efficiency of critical infrastructure across various industries. However, due to their integration into modernized network environments, they are inadvertently exposed to a variety of cybersecurity threats that can compromise the reliability of critical infrastructure. This study aims to enhance ICS security by introducing a Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) based GRU Learning model to detect anomalies of ICS traffic in conjunction with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The model's effectiveness was validated through experiments simulating two major cyberattack scenarios: the 'Stuxnet' attack and the 'Industroyer' attack, achieving over 95% success in attack detection. By mapping the anomalies to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, we were able to lay the groundwork for an efficient response strategy to the attacks. These findings are expected to make a meaningful contribution to assessing and strengthening the security posture of ICS.

AB Demanding scientific evolution and undisrupted resource requirement of consumers signified the amalgamation of mechanical production, mass production, and digitalized production for the fourth industrial revolution, "Industry 4.0." Critical infrastructures that operate and govern industrial sectors and public utilities, such as water desalination plants, smart grids, and gas pipelines, incorporated this cognitive-mechatronic augmentation for the seamless integration of software, control components, and production employees to increase the productivity scale. Although connectivity, automation, and optimization made industrial sectors realize the full potential of smart manufacturing, the inclusion of supervisory control and data acquisition systems into cyberspace expanded the attack vectors that made industrial control systems the prime target for cyber-attackers. Conventional security solutions, such as firewalls, traditional intrusion-detection systems, and antivirus, have been proposed and developed by the research community acted as a proficient line of cyber-defense. However, protecting critical infrastructures from heterogeneous cyber-attacks for resilient operability still pose a significant research challenge. In addition, although machine learning and deep-learning-based intrusion-detection models have been proposed and optimized in the literature, operational viability still poses a significant setback for real-time intrusion detection on industrial control systems. By considering the limitations identified in the literature, a stacked deep-learning model is proposed and validated over laboratory-scale industrial datasets. Furthermore, this article provides an overview of cyber-physical systems, conventional security solutions, and their challenges in identifying unseen exploits. As a concluding remark, JARA: a hybrid opensource deployment-ready intelligent intrusion-detection system, has been presented that feasibly detects the HnS IIoT malware when deployed on a Linux virtual machine.

AB Modern Critical Infrastructure (CI) sectors including Smart Girds operate on the Internet of Things and edge computing paradigm. With the enormous growth of these sectors, there are emerging and escalating cyber threats. Traditional Machine Mearning (ML) approaches strive to provide a certain level of resilience against cyber threats but at the cost of privacy leading towards a single point of vulnerability. Following an exhaustive analysis of traditional ML algorithms and cyber threats to the CI, this work introduces a privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) driven intrusion detection framework to identify cyber threats focusing on the use case of Smart Grids within the CI. This paper firstly implements and compares various traditional ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression which works on a centeralised dataset. Secondly, an analysis has been carried out using the proposed FL-based approach to further improve security and privacy along with minimising the need for centralised dataset. Experimental results highlight that our traditional RF-based approach and FL-based approach achieve high intrusion detection accuracy. However, FL has more significant advantages in distributed and privacy-sensitive environments, protecting privacy and reducing the need for data centralisation.

AB Nowadays, with the rapid development of industrial Internet technology, on the one hand, advanced industrial control systems (ICS) have improved industrial production efficiency. However, there are more and more cyberattacks targeting industrial control systems. To ensure the security of industrial networks, intrusion detection systems have been widely used in industrial control systems, and deep neural networks have always been an effective method for identifying cyber attacks. Current intrusion detection methods still suffer from low accuracy and a high false alarm rate. Therefore, it is important to build a more efficient intrusion detection model. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning intrusion detection method based on convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory neural networks (CNN-BiLSTM). To address the issue of imbalanced data within the dataset and improve the model's detection capabilities, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique-Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMOTE-ENN) algorithm is applied in the preprocessing phase. This algorithm is employed to generate synthetic instances for the minority class, simultaneously mitigating the impact of noise in the majority class. This approach aims to create a more equitable distribution of classes, thereby enhancing the model's ability to effectively identify patterns in both minority and majority classes. In the experimental phase, the detection performance of the method is verified using two data sets. Experimental results show that the accuracy rate on the CICIDS-2017 data set reaches 97.7%. On the natural gas pipeline dataset collected by Lan Turnipseed from Mississippi State University in the United States, the accuracy rate also reaches 85.5%.

AB With the wide applications of industrial wireless network technologies, the industrial control system (ICS) is evolving from wired and centralized to wireless and distributed, during which eavesdropping and attacking become serious problems. To guarantee the security of wireless and distributed ICS, this article establishes an end-edge collaborative lightweight secure federated learning (LSFL) architecture and proposes an LSFL anomaly detection strategy. Specifically, we first design a residual multihead self-attention convolutional neural network for local feature learning, where the variability and dependence of spatial-temporal features can be sufficiently evaluated. Then, to reduce the wireless communication cost for parameter exchange and edge federal learning, we propose a dynamic parameter pruning algorithm by evaluating the contribution of each parameter based on the information entropy gain. Furthermore, to ensure the parameter security during wireless transmission in the open radio environment, we propose an adaptive key generation algorithm for parameter encryption. Finally, the proposed strategy is experimentally validated on representative datasets, including Smart Meter, NSL-KDD, and UNSW-NB15. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves 99% accuracy on different datasets, where at least 89.6% wireless communication cost is reduced and tampering/injecting attacks are defended.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to assist in identifying vulnerabilities in real-world complex heterogeneous industrial control systems (ICS) using two Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimisation (EMO) algorithms, NSGA-II and SPEA2. Our approach is evaluated on a well-known benchmark chemical plant simulator, the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process model. We identified vulnerabilities in individual components of the TE model and then made use of these vulnerabilities to generate combinatorial attacks. The generated attacks were aimed at compromising the safety of the system and inflicting economic loss. Results were compared against random attacks, and the performance of the EMO algorithms was evaluated using hypervolume, spread, and inverted generational distance (IGD) metrics. A defence against these attacks in the form of a novel intrusion detection system was developed, using machine learning algorithms. The designed approach was further tested against the developed detection methods. The obtained results demonstrate that the developed EMO approach is a promising tool in the identification of the vulnerable components of ICS, and weaknesses of any existing detection systems in place to protect the system. The proposed approach can serve as a proactive defense tool for control and security engineers to identify and prioritise vulnerabilities in the system. The approach can be employed to design resilient control strategies and test the effectiveness of security mechanisms, both in the design stage and during the operational phase of the system.

AB In recent years, ICSs have become increasingly commonplace in virtually every industry. The abbreviation "ICSs" refers to industrial control systems. These are specially designed computers used for monitoring, managing, and controlling procedures and tasks across a wide range of industries and vital infrastructure sectors. Production, power, disinfection of water, transport, and other sectors all greatly benefit from ICS use. The authors of this paper aim to detect ICS cyber hazards in industry. This article is the result of the writers' extensive research on ICS programs and the impact of cyberattacks on them as well. The study narrowed its attention to just three ICS applications because there are simply too many to count: power plants, water reservoirs, and gas pipelines. The present paper focuses on the development and evaluation of neural networks for use in cyberattacks. An early form of neural network, the residual system, came first in the field. When a breach is detected in the ICS, the neural network sorts it into one of several categories. The produced datasets must not compromise users' privacy or cause harm to the relevant industry if they fall into the wrong hands. An encoding device, decoder, pseudo-encoder, and critical model neural networks work together to generate random data. Finally, a set of trials is conducted in which a residual neural network is utilized to classify cyberattacks based on both the created and original datasets. Results from a series of studies indicate that using the created dataset is an effective technique to train high-quality neural networks for use in cybersecurity on a large amount of data without sacrificing the accuracy of the models. The Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences also serve as the theoretical foundation and technique, respectively. In particular, the paper recommends operational and maintenance cybersecurity standards for ICS. This entails such things as secure password practices, patch management, and anti-malware defense. Physical safeguards for ICS is another topic that is covered.

AB In an era defined by the relentless advancement of technology, the critical infrastructure that sustains our daily lives has become increasingly reliant on complex digital systems like Internet of Things (IoT). While these complex digital systems have brought convenience and efficiency to critical infrastructure, they have also become prime targets for malicious parties seeking to exploit vulnerabilities, raising concerns across vital sectors like energy, healthcare, transportation, and beyond. Through systematic literature review, historical incident analysis, and examination of recent attacks, this paper aims to deepen our understanding of the evolving threat landscape, emphasizing the urgency of strengthening defenses, particularly in the IoT realm to secure the foundations of modern society. This literature survey encompasses a spectrum of defending technologies and methodologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based defenses, and anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. Analyzing variations techniques and evaluates their efficiency and complexity.

AB Machine learning is commonly used to detect anomalies in industrial control systems (ICS). In general, building an anomaly detection model requires massive training data and computational resources. Therefore, an ideal solution is to use a pre-trained model instead of building each model completely from scratch. However, we cannot directly use a pre-trained model because each ICS dataset has its own unique features and characteristics. This paper proposes a practical transfer learning technique dubbed MENDEL (tiMe sEries aNomaly Detection using transfEr Learning) to efficiently build anomaly detection models, respectively, for different ICS domains. MENDEL first applies principal components analysis (PCA) to each model to obtain a fixed number of reduced features compatible with other models and then finds a reasonable mapping between different models' reduced features systemically for effective transfer learning. We evaluate the performance of MENDEL on two datasets (SWaT and WADI) with two models (InterFusion and USAD). Our evaluation results show that MENDEL can overall achieve high F1 scores even when a model is retrained with only a small proportion of the training dataset. For example, when we first train InterFusion with the SWaT train dataset and then retrain the trained model with only 10% of the entire WADI train dataset, the retrained InterFusion achieves an F1 score of 72%, which is better than an F1 score of 44% achieved by InterFusion with the entire SWAT training dataset.

AB This paper proposes a novel method monitoring network packets to classify anomalies in industrial control systems (ICSs). The proposed method combines different mechanisms. It is flow-based as it obtains new features through aggregating packets of the same flow. It then builds a deep neural network (DNN) with multi-attention blocks for spotting core features, and with residual blocks for avoiding the gradient vanishing problem. The DNN is trained with the Ranger (RAdam + Lookahead) optimizer to prevent the training from being stuck in local minima, and with the focal loss to address the data imbalance problem. The Electra Modbus dataset is used to evaluate the performance impacts of different mechanisms on the proposed method. The proposed method is compared with related methods in terms of the precision, recall, and F1-score to show its superiority.

AB Cyber security encompasses a variety of financial, political, and social aspects with significant implications for the safety of individuals and organisations. Hospitals are among the least secure and most vulnerable organisations in terms of cybersecurity. Protecting medical records from cyberattacks is critical for protecting personal and financial records of those involved in medical institutions. Attack graphs, like in other systems, can be used to protect medical and hospital records from cyberattacks. In the current study, a total of 352 real-life cyberattacks on healthcare institutions using common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) data were statistically examined to determine important trends and specifications in regard to those attacks. Following that, several machine learning techniques and an artificial neural network model were used to model industrial control systems (ICS) vulnerability data of those attacks. The average vulnerability score for attacks on healthcare IT systems was found to be very high. Moreover, this score was found to be higher in healthcare institutions which have experienced cyberattacks in the past and no mitigation actions were implemented. Using Python programming software, the most successful model that can be used in modelling cyberattacks on IT systems of healthcare institutions was found to be the K-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm. The model was then enhanced further and then it was tried to make predictions for future cyberattacks on IT systems of healthcare institutions. Results indicate that the overall score is critical indicating that medical records are, in general, at high risk and that there is a high risk of cyberattacks on medical records in healthcare institutions. It is recommended, therefore, that those institutions should take urgent precautionary measures to mitigate such a high risk of cyberattacks and to make them more secure, reliable, and robust.

AB In this article, a novel unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithm is presented for the expeditious radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting of long range (LoRa)-modulated chirps. Identification based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) alone is unlikely to yield a robust means of authentication for critical infrastructure deployments. This is especially true for LoRa, a low-power and LoRa wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT) air-interface technology, where modulated chirps have constant envelope power and correlated in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) samples when the chirps are directly extracted. This makes traditional cyber intrusion detection techniques via a convolutional neural network (CNN) impractical. Moreover, we also prove that such correlation leads to an orthogonally inseparable dataset, due to which classification becomes intractable. Therefore, we propose an efficient way to produce self-organizing maps (SOMs) of LoRa transmitters (TXs) and a potential rogue node prior to CNN classification. This approach offers SOM orthogonalization, thus minimizing the mean square error (MSE) within the CNN using our specially constituted SOM engine for precisely profiling each LoRa TX. This method demonstrates cent-percent success in recognizing each LoRa TX as either being a legitimate device or a rogue.

AB Hydroelectric power plants (HEPPs) are renewable energy power plants with the highest installed power in the world. The control systems are responsible for stopping the relevant unit safely in case of any malfunction while ensuring the desired operating point. Conventional control systems detect anomalies at certain limits or predefined threshold values by evaluating analog signals regardless of differences caused by operating conditions. In this study, using real data from a large hydro unit (>150 MW), a normal behavior model of a hydraulic governor's oil circulation in an operational HEPP is created using several machine learning methods and historical data obtained from the HEPP's SCADA system. Model outputs resulted in up to 96.45% success of prediction with less than 1% absolute deviation from actual measurements and an R-2 score of 0.985 with the random forest regression method. This novel approach makes the model outputs far more appropriate to use as an active threshold value changing for different operating conditions, eliminating insufficiency of the constant threshold, resulting in the detection of anomalies in early stages and taking precautions accordingly. The study fills the gap in the literature on anomaly detection in hydraulic power units, which is a demanding task with state-of-the-art methods.

TI Privacy-Enhanced Intrusion Detection and Defense for Cyber-Physical
   Systems: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
ID BLOCKCHAIN; 5G
AB Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) will play an important role in future real-world applications through the deep integration of computing, communication, and control technologies. CPSs are increasingly deployed in critical infrastructure, industry, and homes to achieve a smart grid, smart transportation, and smart healthcare and to bring many benefits to citizens, businesses, and governments. However, the openness and complexity brought by network and wireless communication technology, as well as the intelligence and dynamic of network intrusions make CPS more vulnerable to network intrusions and bring more serious threats to human life, enterprise productivity, and national security. Therefore, intrusion detection and defense in CPS have attracted considerable attention and have become a fundamental aspect of CPS security. However, a new challenging problem arises: how to improve the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection while protecting user privacy during the intrusion detection process. To address this challenge, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based privacy-enhanced intrusion detection and defense mechanism (PIDD) for CPS. The PIDD is composed of three modules: privacy-enhanced topology graphs generation module, graph convolutional networks-based user evaluation module, and the deep reinforcement learning-based intruder identification and handling module. The experimental results show that the proposed PIDD achieves excellent performance in intrusion detection accuracy, intrusion defense percentage, and privacy protection.

AB Nowadays, with an increasing expansion of the internet of things (IoT) that has created massive data streams, online attack detection via stream processing has become a matter of extensive attention. Current encryption and authentication methods cannot satisfy the security requirements of IoT critical infrastructures because of many heterogeneous connected devices, a wide network geographical scope, rapid software development, the possibility of security bugs, and the emergence of new attacks. Therefore, an extended method based on machine learning, which can process data stream to detect the fog layer's IoT attacks and prevent the spread of intrusion to other network segments, was proposed in this paper. The IFogLearn++ uses a fog layer to facilitate fast data stream processing in the fog layer. Using a fog layer helps the network tolerate more attacks due to the annexation of an extra security layer before the cloud layer. Based on the results, the IFogLearn++ has similar accuracy to competitors and 18 and 8 times faster performance compared to SVM and Learn++. This characteristic helps secure massive data streams in IoT.

AB As the complexity and scale of the network environment increase continuously, various methods to detect attacks and intrusions from network traffic by classifying normal and abnormal network behaviors show their limitations. The number of network traffic signatures is increasing exponentially to the extent that semi-realtime detection is not possible. However, machine learningbased intrusion detection only gives simple guidelines as simple contents of security events. This is why security data for a specific environment cannot be configured due to data noise, diversification, and continuous alteration of a system and network environments. Although machine learning is performed and evaluated using a generalized data set, its performance is expected to be similar in that specific network environment only. In this study, we propose a high-speed outlier detection method for a network dataset to customize the dataset in real-time for a continuously changing network environment. The proposed method uses an ensemble-based noise data filtering model using the voting results of 6 classifiers (decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression) to reflect the distribution and various environmental characteristics of datasets. Moreover, to prove the performance of the proposed method, we experimented with the accuracy of attack detection by gradually reducing the noise data in the time series dataset. As a result of the experiment, the proposed method maintains a training dataset of a size capable of semi-real-time learning, which is 10% of the total training dataset, and at the same time, shows the same level of accuracy as a detection model using a large training dataset. The improved research results would be the basis for automatic tuning of network datasets and machine learning that can be applied to special-purpose environments and devices such as ICS environments.

AB Digital twins can address the problem of data scarcity during the training machine learning models, as they can be used to simulate and explore a range of process conditions and system states that are too difficult or dangerous to explore in real-world Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Meanwhile, advances in industrial control systems technology have enabled increasingly complex functionality to be deployed on or near so-called edge devices, such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).
   In this paper, we propose a methodology for training a machine learning model offline using data extracted from a digital twin, before converting the model for deployment on an edge device to perform anomaly detection. To examine the model's suitability for anomaly detection, we execute several simulations of fault conditions. Results show that the model can successfully predict normal operations as well as identify faults and cyber-attacks. There is a negligible drop in performance on the edge device, when compared to executing the model on a personal computer, but it remains suitable for the application.

AB Cyberattack detection modeling on a smart grid and critical networks is rising due to the growing number of successful, sophisticated attacks to industrial controllers and critical infrastructure using False Data Injection Attack (FDIA), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), and Data replay attacks. Integrating Deep Learning algorithms, i.e., Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), with Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDs), and Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDs) can improve the critical infrastructures' accuracy during anomaly detection, class classification, and ingress packet filtering. This paper leveraged the ANN's sequential classifier in training, testing, and accurately predicting the attack vectors held in the NSL-KDD dataset, which led to the proposal of a hybrid Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) Sequential-Feedforward Neural Network (SEQ-FFNN). NSL-KDD is a foundational cyber-attack modeling dataset that holds transmission protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, and POP, critical to packet propagation in all networking infrastructures. SEQ-FFNN is a self-learning model that performs a Principal component analysis, Hyperparametization, Testing, Training, and Prediction of accurate outputs; during each code iteration. SEQ-FFNN detected and classified the attack packets to return improved accuracy of 98.97% for Tanh activated layers and 99.59% for the Sigmoid activated model.

AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have gained popularity due to the increased requirements on their uninterrupted connectivity and process automation. Due to their connectivity over the network including intranet and internet, dependence on sensitive data, heterogeneous nature, and large-scale deployment, they are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are performed by creating anomalies in the normal operation of the systems with a goal either to disrupt the operation or destroy the system completely. The study proposed here focuses on detecting those anomalies which could be the cause of cyber-attacks. This is achieved by deriving the rules that govern the physical behavior of a process within a plant. These rules are called Invariants. We have proposed a Data-Centric approach (DaC) to generate such invariants. The entire study was conducted using the operational data of a functional smart power grid which is also a living lab.

TI A Methodology for Evaluating the Robustness of Anomaly Detectors to

AB Anomaly Detection systems based on Machine and Deep learning are the most promising solutions to detect cyberattacks in the industry. However, these techniques are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that downgrade prediction performance. Several techniques have been proposed to measure the robustness of Anomaly Detection in the literature. However, they do not consider that, although a small perturbation in an anomalous sample belonging to an attack, i.e., Denial of Service, could cause it to be misclassified as normal while retaining its ability to damage, an excessive perturbation might also transform it into a truly normal sample, with no real impact on the industrial system. This paper presents a methodology to calculate the robustness of Anomaly Detection models in industrial scenarios. The methodology comprises four steps and uses a set of additional models called support models to determine if an adversarial sample remains anomalous. We carried out the validation using the Tennessee Eastman process, a simulated testbed of a chemical process. In such a scenario, we applied the methodology to both a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) focused on detecting anomalies produced by different cyberattacks. The experiments showed that 1D-CNN is significantly more robust than LSTM for our testbed. Specifically, a perturbation of 60% (empirical robustness of 0.6) of the original sample is needed to generate adversarial samples for LSTM, whereas in 1D-CNN the perturbation required increases up to 111% (empirical robustness of 1.11).

AB To tackle with advanced persistent threats against industrial control system, Siemens has developed S7CommPlusTLS, a new version of the encrypted protocol challenging traditional DPI-based anomaly detection methods. However, the communication mode of industrial control system leads to the overlapping of periodic traffic and sensitive behavior traffic, and thus makes mainstream encrypted traffic classification methods exhibit a poor performance in S7CommPlus-TLS protocol. Therefore, we design a multiple clustering framework called MCFM, which can automatically extract sensitive behavior of S7CommPlus-TLS from network traffic. The first-clustering is used as a pre-processing model to separate and remove periodic traffic from overlapping flows according to the communication mode of industrial control system. Besides, we employ the secondclustering as a generator to extract the fingerprint of sensitive behaviors. Our comprehensive experiments on the simulation dataset covering six sensitive behaviors indicate that MCFM achieves an excellent performance, and outperforms present cutting-edge methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work analyzing industrial control system from the perspective of encrypted traffic analysis.

AB In traditional network anomaly detection algorithms, the anomaly threshold needs to be defined manually. Keeping this as background, this study proposes an anomaly detection algorithm (VAEOCSVM), which combines the variable auto-encoder (VAE) and one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) to realize anomaly detection in industrial control networks. First, the VAE model is used to obtain the distribution of the original normal sample data represented by the low-dimensional code; the reconstruction error of the VAE model is merged into the new input. Then, using OCSVM's hinge-loss objective function and the random Fourier feature fitting radial basis function (RBF) kernel method, the OCSVM model is represented and solved using the deep neural network and gradient descent method. Finally, the decision function of the OCSVM model is constructed by using the solved parameter information to realize the detection of abnormal data. The proposed algorithm is compared with other machine-learning-based anomaly detection algorithms in terms of multiple indicators such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The experimental results using various datasets show that the proposed algorithm has a better outlier recognition ability than the machine-learning-based anomaly detection algorithms.

AB This paper describes a testbed that features opensource software and functioning physical processes to model contemporary control systems found in a hydroelectric dam and canal configuration intended for conveying water to farmland. Didactic descriptions of the testbed intend to provide researchers a replicable tool in cybersecurity in critical infrastructure in the Food and Agricultural Sector. Captured network telemetry metrics in addition to network traffic in data logs provide potential insight for training adaptable machine learning models. Use cases in attack scenarios, data logging, and vulnerability assessment illustrate the pragmatic utility of a high-fidelity cyber testbed.

AB This paper proposes a novel method to detect counterfeit and anomalous integrated circuits (ICs). The method involves comparing IC signatures that are obtained by placing the IC inside the cavity resonator and measuring the scattering parameters (S-parameters) with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The S-parameters are collected between 10 GHz and 19 GHz. The data from the signatures are then preprocessed and split into a training and test dataset. The training dataset is used to train a support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm implemented in the Python programming language. The test dataset is used to test the algorithm's accuracy. Measurements and tests are done on ICs of several different packaging types, technologies, and authenticities. The results indicate that the method distinguishes counterfeit ICs from authentic ICs in all cases tested; however, is not as accurate in distinguishing similar authentic ICs. It is likely that some of the false positives amongst the authentic ICs are ICs that contain manufacturing defects.

   anomaly detection
AB Cyber-Physical Systems are widely used in critical infrastructures such as the power grids, water purification systems, nuclear plants, oil refinery and compressor plants, food manufacturing, etc. Anomalies in these systems can be a result of cybersecurity attacks, failed sensors or communication channels. Undetected anomalies may lead to process failure, cause financial damage and have significant impact on human lives. Thus, it is important to detect anomalies at early stages and to protect data in Cyber-Physical Systems. In this paper, we propose the novel on-the-fly NIST-compliant key generation scheme for a secure data container used to transfer and store sensor data. The data container delivers data from the low-level field sensors to high-level data analysis servers in a protected form. It provides data confidentiality and integrity, as well as data origin integrity, a fine-grained role-based and attribute-based access control. As a result, the anomaly detector runs on trustworthy data sets, protected from unauthorized adversarial modifications. Our solution can be easily integrated with many existing Cyber-Physical Systems and IT infrastructures since our secure data container supports RESTful API and is implemented in two modifications: (1) signed, watermarked and encrypted spreadsheet file; (2) signed and encrypted JSON file. In addition, we implemented several machine learning models based on a Random Forest, a k-Nearest Neighbors, a Support Vector Machine and a Neural Network algorithms for the detection of various anomalies and attacks in a gas pipeline system. We will demonstrate that our anomaly detection models achieve high detection rate with an average accuracy of 97.7 % for two industrial data sets collected by the Mississippi State University's Critical Infrastructure Protection Center and Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL).

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a prominent role in monitoring and controlling the Critical Infrastructures (CIs) such as water distribution, nuclear plants, and chemical industries. On the other hand, SCADA systems are highly exposed to new vulnerabilities as it highly relies on the internet. Machine learning approaches have been employed to detect the cyberattacks injected by the attackers in CIs. However, those approaches failed to protect the CIs against the ever-advancing nature of cyberattacks. This work presents Salp Swarm Optimization-based Isolation Forest (SSO-IF) to build an efficient SCADA intrusion detection system, and the experiments were carried out using power system dataset from Mississippi State University. The performance of SSO-IF was validated over the state-of-the-art intrusion detection techniques in terms of classification accuracy and detection rate.

AB We propose a new anomaly detection system to defend against semantic attacks on the command and control communication in safety-critical railway signalling networks. To this end, we train artificial neural network on the communication of signal boxes connected to their signals, points, and train detection system. We show that it is possible to predict the next command with knowledge of only few previously transmitted datagrams. We optimize the parameters of the artificial neural network, determine the optimal number of previous datagrams, and show that our approach is viable in railway stations of various size. Using the artificial neural network, we construct an anomaly detection system to classify each observed datagram to raise an alert in case of deviant behaviour. We further optimize the anomaly detection's threshold and show that our classifier is able to operate with a false positive rate of 0.03 and a false negative rate of 0.04.

AB Recent cyberattacks targeting Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)/Industrial Control System(ICS) exploit weaknesses of host system software environment and take over the control of host processes in the host of the station network. We analyze the attack path of these attacks, which features how the attack hijacks the host in the network and compromises the operations of field device controllers. The paper proposes a host-based protection method, which can prevent malware penetration into the process memory by code injection attacks. The method consists of two protection schemes. One is to prevent file-based code injection such as DLL injection. The other is to prevent fileless code injection. The method traces changes in memory regions and determine whether the newly allocated memory is written with malicious codes. For this method, we show how a machine learning method can be adopted.

AB In recent years, artificial intelligence has been widely used in the field of network security, which has significantly improved the effect of network security analysis and detection. However, because the power industrial control system is faced with the problem of shortage of attack data, the direct deployment of the network intrusion detection system based on artificial intelligence is faced with the problems of lack of data, low precision, and high false alarm rate. To solve this problem, we propose an anomaly traffic detection method based on cross-domain knowledge transferring. By using the TrAdaBoost algorithm, we achieve a lower error rate than using LSTM alone.

AB Continuous security monitoring provides an effective proactive defense against devastating attacks on critical infrastructures such as those operated by industrial control systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. An essential component of a continuous security monitoring system is an intelligent backend that is built and trained to handle real-time data analytics. A plethora of data sets for intrusion detection systems and network usage facilitated numerous research works on intrusion detection systems and network usage analytics. Although the need for test data sets for ICS security is quite pronounced, there is a discernible deficiency of the availability of such data sets. The contribution of this research is to close that identified gap by generating a test data set using an ICS testbed and to utilize machine learning algorithms for its evaluation.

AB Interconnected computing units are used more and more in our daily lives, starting from the transportation systems and ending with gas and electricity distribution, together with tenths or hundreds of systems and sensors, called critical infrastructures. In this context, cyber protection is vital because they represent one of the most important parts of a country's economy thus making them very attractive to cyber criminals or malware attacks. Even though the detection technologies for new threats have improved over time, modern malware still manage to pass even the most secure and well organized computer networks, firewalls and intrusion detection equipments, making all systems vulnerable. This is the main reason that automatic learning is used more often than any other detection algorithms as it can learn from existing attacks and prevent newer ones.
   In this paper we discuss the issues threatening critical infrastructures systems and propose a framework based on machine learning algorithms and game theory decision models that can be used to protect such systems. We present the results taken after implementing it using three distinct classifiers - k nearest neighbors, decision trees and support vector machines.

AB The reliability of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is crucial given their substantial importance in society and business. These systems are susceptible to physical and cyber-attacks, which can seriously affect human life and the economy. Given the growing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and the possibility of cyber warfare, it is essential to prioritize safeguarding Industrial Control Systems (ICS) from cyberattacks. Previous studies revealed an imbalance in the ICS datasets. As a result, models didn't do well in minority classes but did well in majority classes, which made the intrusion detection system (IDS) less useful. The key objective is to provide insights into the normal functioning of the system and the disruptions produced by cyberattacks. In this study, we introduced an interdisciplinary framework that aims to enhance network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs). In this framework, we introduced an IDS via feature selection and feature reduction technique(s) with the attention-driven lightweight deep neural networks: Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Several feature selection techniques exclude features that fail to match the specified criteria. We employed Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) to extract higher-order features. We conducted experiments on the three datasets: the Secure Water Treatment System (SWaT), the Water Distribution (WADI), and the Gas Heating Loop (GHL). Among the models used in the framework, the attention-driven Deep LSTM model produced better results than the others, revealing lower training and testing times for the three datasets. In terms of precision, recall, F1-score, computational speed, and ability to work with larger datasets and different ICSs, the proposed framework is better than previous methods in detecting cyberattacks.

AB The rapid expansion of Edge and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has intensified the risk and complexity of cyberattacks. Detecting advanced intrusions in these heterogeneous and high-dimensional environments remains challenging. As the IIoT becomes integral to critical infrastructure, ensuring security is crucial to prevent disruptions and data breaches. Traditional IDS approaches often fall short against evolving threats, highlighting the need for intelligent and adaptive solutions. While deep learning (DL) offers strong capabilities for pattern recognition, single-model architectures often lack robustness. Thus, hybrid and optimized DL models are increasingly necessary to improve detection performance and address data imbalance and noise. In this study, we propose an optimized hybrid DL framework that combines a transformer, generative adversarial network (GAN), and autoencoder (AE) components, referred to as Transformer-GAN-AE, for robust intrusion detection in Edge and IIoT environments. To enhance the training and convergence of the GAN component, we integrate an improved chimp optimization algorithm (IChOA) for hyperparameter tuning and feature refinement. The proposed method is evaluated using three recent and comprehensive benchmark datasets, WUSTL-IIoT-2021, EdgeIIoTset, and TON_IoT, widely recognized as standard testbeds for IIoT intrusion detection research. Extensive experiments are conducted to assess the model's performance compared to several state-of-the-art techniques, including standard GAN, convolutional neural network (CNN), deep belief network (DBN), time-series transformer (TST), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Evaluation metrics include accuracy, recall, AUC, and run time. Results demonstrate that the proposed Transformer-GAN-AE framework outperforms all baseline methods, achieving a best accuracy of 98.92%, along with superior recall and AUC values. The integration of IChOA enhances GAN stability and accelerates training by optimizing hyperparameters. Together with the transformer for temporal feature extraction and the AE for denoising, the hybrid architecture effectively addresses complex, imbalanced intrusion data. The proposed optimized Transformer-GAN-AE model demonstrates high accuracy and robustness, offering a scalable solution for real-world Edge and IIoT intrusion detection.

ID SOFTWARE-DEFINED NETWORKING; THREATS
AB Network infrastructure evolution has significantly expanded the attack surface, leading to increasingly complex and sophisticated cybersecurity threats. Traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) often fail to detect emerging attack vectors, prompting the need for intelligent, data-driven approaches. This study evaluates and compares the performance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for network intrusion detection. Two publicly available datasets were utilized: a binary-labeled software-defined networking (SDN) dataset and a multiclass industrial control system dataset based on the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol. Preprocessing steps included normalization, label encoding, and a 70:10:20 train-validation-test split. Seven models, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, Convolutional Neural Network, Gated Recurrent Unit, and Long Short-Term Memory, were trained and evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score. The Random Forest model achieved the highest F1-score of 93.57 % on the IEC 60870-5-104 dataset, while XGBoost attained a nearperfect F1-score of 99.97 % on the SDN dataset. These results outperform comparable models in the literature and offer practical insights for selecting effective IDS solutions based on classification type and dataset structure.

AB Considering SCADA systems operate and manage critical infrastructure and industrial processes, the need for robust intrusion detection systems-IDSs cannot be overemphasized. The complexity of these systems, added to their increased exposure to more sophisticated cyber-attacks, creates significant challenges for continuous, secure operations. Traditional approaches to intrusion detection usually fail to cope, scale, or be as accurate as is necessary when dealing with the modern, multi-faceted problem of an attack vector against SCADA networks and IIoT environments. Past works have generally proposed the use of different machine learning and deep learning anomaly detection strategies to find possible intrusions. While these methods have, in fact, been promising, their effects are not without their own set of problems, including high false positives, poor generalization to new types of attacks, and performance inefficiencies in large-scale data environments. In this work, against this background, two novel IDS models are put forward: SPARK (Scalable Predictive Anomaly Response Kernel) and SAD (Scented Alpine Descent), to further improve the security landscape in SCADA systems. SPARK enables an ensemble-based deep learning framework combining strategic feature extraction with adaptive learning mechanisms for volume data processing at high accuracy and efficiency. This architecture has stringent anomaly detection through a multi-layered deep network adapting to ever-evolving contexts in operational environments, allowing for low latency and high precision in the detections. The SAD model works in concert with SPARK by adopting a synergistic approach that embeds deep learning into anomaly scoring algorithms, enabled to detect subtle attack patterns and further reduce false-positive rates.

AB The rapid expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has revolutionized industrial automation and introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) often struggle to effectively identify and mitigate complex cyberthreats, such as denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This study proposes an advanced IDS framework integrating machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid models to enhance cybersecurity in IIoT environments. Using the WUSTL-IIoT-2021 dataset, multiple classification models-including decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and hybrid deep learning architectures-were systematically evaluated based on key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This research introduces several key innovations. First, it presents a comparative analysis of machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid models within a unified experimental framework, offering a comprehensive evaluation of various approaches. Second, while existing studies frequently favor hybrid models, findings from this study reveal that the standalone MLP model outperforms other architectures, achieving the highest detection accuracy of 99.99%. This outcome highlights the critical role of dataset-specific feature distributions in determining model effectiveness and calls for a more nuanced approach when selecting detection models for IIoT cybersecurity applications. Additionally, the study explores a broad range of hyperparameter configurations, optimizing model effectiveness for IIoT-specific intrusion detection. These contributions provide valuable insights for developing more efficient and adaptable IDS solutions in IIoT networks.

AB The security of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has emerged as a prominent concern in cyber-security due to the potential impact of attacks against IIoT on physical infrastructure. Machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) recently have been demonstrated to be an effective tool for protecting the systems in IIoT. However, the vulnerability of ML-based IDSs to adversarial attacks hinders their further application in IIoT. This article aims to further explore the adversarial attacks in IIoT to better evaluate the security of ML-based IDSs in this area. Our research primarily focuses on the generation of universal adversarial perturbations in IIoT, a topic that received limited attention in previous literature. Two novel attack methods based on a unified framework are proposed to utilize the original input-dependent adversarial perturbations of gradient-based or optimization-based adversarial attack methods to craft universal adversarial perturbations with better performance and transferability. The proposed attack methods conceal the underlying implementation details of the target attack methods, exploiting the original adversarial perturbations in a closed-box manner. This enhances their flexibility, making them applicable in a wider range of scenarios and enabling them to be combined with most gradient-based or optimization-based attack methods. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three mainstream intrusion detection data sets, i.e., NSL-KDD, Gas Pipeline, and edge-IIoTset, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of universal adversarial perturbations in IIoT and the superiority of the proposed methods to state-of-the-art attack methods.

AB False-Data Injection Attack (FDIA), Remote-Tripping Command Injection (RTCI), and System Reconfiguration Attack (SRA) on SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks impact industry 5.0 enabled smart grid components such as intelligent-electronic-device (IED), circuit-breaker, network-switch, and power transmission lines. Since the SCADA-network-based cyber-attacking flow is not in digital-twin form, it is impossible to simulate the effects of the attack. Furthermore, the string nature of these affected components' data makes it challenging to incorporate into machine-learning-enabled intelligence (CTI) processes. To visualize the attacking flow of FDIA, RTCI, and SRA cyber-attacks on SCADA networks, this paper presents a novel "Digital Twin and Machine Learning empowered Cyber Attacking Flow Analysis (DT-ML-CAFA)" approach for grid CTI in Industry 5.0. To process digital twins and determine how the cyberattacks are impacting SCADA components, the directed-graph (DiGraph) algorithm-based knowledge-graph method is utilized. The overall digital-twin process is examined using machine learning techniques based on Extra-Trees, Random-Forest, Bootstrap-Aggregating (Bagging), XGBoost, and Logistic-Regression. Based on the experimental results of this study, this paper shows that the proposed method can simulate the flow of cyber-attacks on the SCADA network in the form of the digital twin, and the confusion metrics of the digital twin are obtained with high accuracy.

AB In the face of rapidly evolving cyber threats, network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) have become critical to the security of industrial and robotic systems. This survey explores the specialized requirements, advancements, and challenges unique to deploying NIDS within these environments, where traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often fall short. This paper discusses NIDS methodologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid systems, which aim to improve detection accuracy, adaptability, and real-time response. Additionally, this paper addresses the complexity of industrial settings, limitations in current datasets, and the cybersecurity needs of cyber-physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The survey provides a comprehensive overview of modern approaches and their suitability for industrial applications by reviewing relevant datasets, emerging technologies, and sector-specific challenges. This underscores the importance of innovative solutions, such as federated learning, blockchain, and digital twins, to enhance the security and resilience of NIDS in safeguarding industrial and robotic systems.

AB By enhancing user authentication protocols, especially in critical infrastructures vulnerable to complex cyberthreats, we present an advanced approach that integrates a deep learning-based model and data fusion techniques applied to analyze keystroke dynamics. With the growing need for robust security measures, especially in critical infrastructure environments, traditional authentication mechanisms often fail to cope with advanced threats. Our approach focuses on the unique behavioral biometric characteristics of keystrokes, which offers promising opportunities to improve user authentication processes. We have developed a data fusion-based methodology that utilizes the unique features of keystroke dynamics combined with deep learning techniques to improve user authentication systems. Using the capabilities of data fusion and deep learning, the proposed methodology not only captures the complex behavioral biometrics inherent in keystroke dynamics but also addresses the challenges posed by varying password lengths and typing styles. We conducted extensive experiments on several fixed-text datasets, including the Carnegie Mellon University dataset, the KeyRecs dataset, and the GREYC-NISLAB dataset, with a total of approximately 54,000 password records. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets with different password lengths have shown that our approach is scalable and accurate for user authentication, which significantly improves the security of critical infrastructure. By using interpolation-based data fusion techniques to standardize the keystroke data to a uniform length and employing a Siamese neural network with a triplet loss function, the best equal error rate of 0.13281 was achieved for the unseen fused data. The integration of deep learning and data fusion effectively generalizes to different user profiles, demonstrating its adaptability and accuracy in authenticating users in different scenarios. The findings are crucial for improving security in sensitive applications, ranging from accessing personal devices to protecting critical infrastructure.

AB Anomaly detection of industrial control systems (ICS) based on sensor data analytic is of utmost importance because ICS may suffer from various attacks leading to anomaly behaviors and even equipment failures. As an emerging deep learning technique, deep support vector data description (DeSVDD) has been successfully applied to ICS anomaly detection. Its advantage lies in only requiring normal data to train one-class classifier, which is suitable for actual industrial scenarios with extremely data imbalance of abundant normal data and scare abnormal data. However, this also results in its shortcoming of ignoring the valuable classification information hidden in the abnormal data. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes an improved DeSVDD method, called radius constraint DeSVDD (RC-DeSVDD). The proposed model constructs an anomaly detection model framework of abnormal data assisted DeSVDD, where a radius constraint is designed by considering the difference between normal and abnormal data. Further, considering the limited amount of abnormal data, a bi-directional generative adversarial network (BiGAN) is introduced to generate abnormal data. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RC-DeSVDD anomaly detection method.

AB In today's cyber environment, threats such as data breaches, cyberattacks, and unauthorized access threaten national security, critical infrastructure, and financial stability. This research addresses the challenging task of protecting critical infrastructure from insider threats because of the high level of trust and access these individuals typically receive. Insiders may obtain a system administrator's password through close observation or by deploying software to gather the information. To solve this issue, an innovative artificial intelligence-based methodology is proposed to identify a user by their password's keystroke dynamics. This paper also introduces a new Gabor Filter Matrix Transformation method to transform numerical values into images by revealing the behavioral pattern of password typing. A siamese neural network (SNN) with the branches of convolutional neural networks is utilized for image comparison, aiming to detect unauthorized attempts to access critical infrastructure systems. The network analyzes the unique features of a user's password timestamps transformed into images and compares them with previously submitted user passwords. The obtained results indicate that transforming the numerical values of keystroke dynamics into images and training an SNN leads to a lower equal error rate (EER) and higher user authentication accuracy than those previously reported in other studies. The methodology is validated on publicly available keystroke dynamics collections, the CMU and GREYC-NISLAB datasets, which collectively comprise over 30,000 password samples. It achieves the lowest EER value of 0.04545 compared to state-of-the-art methods for transforming non-image data into images. The paper concludes with a discussion of findings and potential future directions.

DT Article
AB The number of attacks against Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices has increased over the past years, particularly on widely used communication protocols like Message Queuing Telemetry Transfer (MQTT). The fast increase in IIoT applications brings both critical challenges and technical gaps in cybersecurity. On the other hand, traditional cyber-attack detection approaches scrap to address and support the run-time responsibilities of IIoT environments. This study presents a hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Random Forest (GA_RF) method for detecting cyber-attacks in Industrial Control Machines (ICS) that use MQTT protocol in the IIoT environment. This architecture integrates ICS with edge devices and cloud servers, using a GA_RF algorithm to detect anomalies in data collected by sensors. Normal data is processed locally and then sent to the cloud for storage and return, ensuring continuous monitoring and security. Also, the MQTT-IOT-IDS2020 dataset as a real test case was applied for prediction of the proposed GA_RF method with compare to some other powerful machine and deep learning models. The experimental results show that the proposed GA_RF method has an optimum accuracy of 99.87%-100% for detecting cyber-attacks. This hybrid algorithm also achieved 0-0.0015 in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 100% in Precision, Recall, and F-score factors. This result led to the proposed architecture, which connects the ICS to a server while running GA_RF on the IIoT environment. In conclusion, this study indicates the effectiveness of GA_RF and aims to improve security by using the MQTT protocol in IIoT.

AB Security adversaries are rampant on the Internet, constantly seeking vulnerabilities to exploit. The sheer proliferation of these sophisticated threats necessitates innovative and swift defensive measures to protect the vulnerable infrastructure. Tools such as honeypots effectively determine adversary behavior and safeguard critical organizational systems. However, it takes a significant amount of time to analyze these attacks on the honeypots, and by the time actionable intelligence is gathered from the attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), it is often too late to prevent potential damage to the organization's critical systems. This paper contributes to the advancement of cybersecurity practices by presenting a cutting-edge methodology, capitalizing on the synergy between artificial intelligence and threat analysis to combat evolving cyber threats. The current research articulates a novel strategy, outlining a method to analyze large volumes of attacker data from honeypots utilizing large language models (LLMs) to assimilate TTPs and apply this knowledge to identify real-time anomalies in regular user activity. The effectiveness of this model is tested in real-world scenarios, demonstrating a notable reduction in response time for detecting malicious activities in critical infrastructure. Moreover, we delve into the proposed framework's practical implementation considerations and scalability, underscoring its adaptability in diverse organizational contexts.

AB Industrial control systems (ICSs), as critical national infrastructures, are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated security threats. To address this challenge, our study introduces the CAE-T, a deep convolutional autoencoding transformer network designed for efficient anomaly detection and real-time fault monitoring in ICS. The CAE-T utilizes unsupervised deep learning, employing a convolutional autoencoder for spatial feature extraction from multidimensional time-series data, and combines this with a transformer architecture to capture long-term temporal dependencies. The design of the model facilitates rapid training and inference, while its dual-component approach, utilizing an optimization function based on support vector data description (SVDD), enhances detection accuracy. This integration synergistically combines spatiotemporal feature extraction, significantly improving the robustness and precision of anomaly detection in ICS environments. The CAE-T model demonstrated notable performance enhancements across three industrial control system datasets. Notably, the CAE-T model achieved approximately a 70.8% increase in F1 score and a 9.2% rise in AUC on the WADI dataset. On the SWaT dataset, the model showed improvements of approximately 2.8% in F1 score and 5% in AUC. The power system dataset saw more modest gains, with an approximately 0.1% uptick in F1 score and a 1% increase in AUC. These improvements validate the CAE-T model's efficacy and robustness in anomaly detection across various scenarios.

AB Securing critical infrastructure, particularly nuclear power plants, against emerging cyber threats necessitates innovative cybersecurity approaches. This research introduces FusionGuard, a hybrid machine learning-based anomaly detection system designed for early warnings of ransomware and spyware intrusions within nuclear power plant systems. Meticulously tailored to the unique characteristics of nuclear power plant networks, FusionGuard leverages diverse datasets encompassing normal operational behavior and historical threat data. Through cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, the system dynamically adapts to the network's baseline behavior, effectively identifying deviations indicative of ransomware or spyware activities. Rigorous experimentation and validation using real-world data and simulated attack scenarios affirm FusionGuard's proficiency in detecting anomalous behavior with remarkable accuracy and minimal false positives. The research also explores the system's scalability and adaptability to evolving attack vectors, fortifying the cybersecurity posture of nuclear power plant systems in a dynamic threat landscape. In summary, FusionGuard promises to fortify the security of nuclear power plant systems against ransomware and spyware threats by capitalizing on machine learning and anomaly detection. Serving as a sentinel, the system issues timely alerts and enables proactive responses, contributing substantively to the ongoing discourse on protecting essential systems in high-stakes environments.

AB The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one of the most pernicious threats in cyberspace. Catastrophic failures over the past two decades have resulted in catastrophic and costly disruption of services across all sectors and critical infrastructure. Machine-learning-based approaches have shown promise in developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for detecting cyber-attacks, such as DDoS. Herein, we present a solution to detect DDoS attacks through an ensemble-based machine learning approach that combines supervised and unsupervised machine learning ensemble frameworks. This combination produces higher performance in detecting known DDoS attacks using supervised ensemble and for zero-day DDoS attacks using an unsupervised ensemble. The unsupervised ensemble, which employs novelty and outlier detection, is effective in identifying prior unseen attacks. The ensemble framework is tested using three well-known benchmark datasets, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017. The results show that ensemble classifiers significantly outperform single-classifier-based approaches. Our model with combined supervised and unsupervised ensemble models correctly detects up to 99.1% of the DDoS attacks, with a negligible rate of false alarms.

AB Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, particularly Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), are vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to their limited computing resources. This study addresses the need for a reliable, publicly available dataset for comprehensive attack detection experiments in SCADA networks. We developed a dataset for SCADA systems operating under the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol in an electricity distribution network. Using a hybrid virtual-physical testbed that simulates SCADA communications, we generated normal and attack scenarios, including port scans, brute force attacks, ICMP floods, SYN floods, Xmas scans, and IEC 104 floods. Snort and Suricata verified the integrity of the dataset. We then evaluated six Intrusion Detection System (IDS) models using different machine learning algorithms, i.e.: Artificial Neural Network, Categorical Na & iuml;ve Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. The Decision Tree and Random Forest models achieved the highest accuracy of 93.66%. This dataset aims to support further research and development of robust IDS solutions for SCADA systems.

AB The widespread adoption of networked technology has led to a digital revolution in interconnected systems, resulting in a significant increase in the attack surface and a corresponding rise in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks. The integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS) into critical infrastructure has made their security against intrusions of paramount importance. To address this issue, the analysis of network traffic through Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has emerged as a critical element in the arsenal of network security tools. In response to the growing rate and complexity of cyber-attacks, researchers have turned to Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods to develop IDS capable of addressing network attacks. However, the effectiveness of these models is reliant on the availability of data. This study emphasizes an empirical analysis of a decentralized learning framework for detecting intrusions in CPS. The proposed approach adopts a comprehensive framework that utilizes federated learning to overcome the limitations imposed by centralized data. The study also incorporates privacy mechanisms, such as differential privacy, to strengthen intrusion detection systems. The analysis of centralized and decentralized learning scenarios reveals nuanced insights into detection performance, offering a novel perspective on securing CPS network environments. While the centralized approach demonstrates slightly better detection performance, its impact on data privacy jeopardizes its suitability for real-world implementation. The outcomes highlight the efficiency and efficacy of the devised framework, establishing a model capable of effectively classifying distinct benign and intrusive traffic patterns without inter-organizational exchange of data.

AB In the intricate landscape of the cybersecurity, critical infrastructures represent the most vital systems underpinning the societal and economic wellbeing, with their disruption or incapacitation having potentially catastrophic consequences. The increasing complexity, digitalization and interconnectedness of these systems have rendered them susceptible to a broad spectrum of risks challenging the existing paradigm of the safety and security. Thus, securing critical infrastructures against the escalating cybersecurity threats has become an essential yet extremely challenging endeavour. In the light of these considerations, the paper offers a deeper understanding of the dynamic, adaptive and intelligence-driven approaches in the cyber defence that leverage the AI power, thus representing a transformative innovation with a potential to redefine the security strategies and frameworks in critical infrastructures. The cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities are addressed and the existing and emerging approaches and best practices in the sector-specific intrusion detection and prevention systems and deception technology are investigated, followed by an in-depth study of AI applications in the cyber defence. This includes the current approaches and early best practices complemented by a discussion on advanced topics, such as explainable and adversarial AI. Finally, guidelines are drafted to inform and provide guidance on the introduction of the AI applications for the cyber defence purposes in critical infrastructures.

AB Cyber threats to industrial control systems (ICSs) have increased as information and communications technology (ICT) has been incorporated. In response to these cyber threats, we are implementing a range of security equipment and specialized training programs. Anomaly data stemming from cyber-attacks are crucial for effectively testing security equipment and conducting cyber training exercises. However, securing anomaly data in an ICS environment requires a lot of effort. For this reason, we propose a method for generating anomaly data that reflects cyber-attack characteristics. This method uses systematic sampling and linear regression models in an ICS environment to generate anomaly data reflecting cyber-attack characteristics based on benign data. The method uses statistical analysis to identify features indicative of cyber-attack characteristics and alters their values from benign data through systematic sampling. The transformed data are then used to train a linear regression model. The linear regression model can predict features because it has learned the linear relationships between data features. This experiment used ICS_PCAPS data generated based on Modbus, frequently used in ICS. In this experiment, more than 50,000 new anomaly data pieces were generated. As a result of using some of the new anomaly data generated as training data for the existing model, no significant performance degradation occurred. Additionally, comparing some of the new anomaly data with the original benign and attack data using kernel density estimation confirmed that the new anomaly data pattern was changing from benign data to attack data. In this way, anomaly data that partially reflect the pattern of the attack data were created. The proposed method generates anomaly data like cyber-attack data quickly and logically, free from the constraints of cost, time, and original cyber-attack data required in existing research.

AB With the continuous modernization of water plants, the risk of cyberattacks on them potentially endangers public health and the economic efficiency of water treatment and distribution. This article signifies the importance of developing improved techniques to support cyber risk management for critical water infrastructure, given an evolving threat environment. In particular, we propose a method that uniquely combines machine learning, the theory of belief functions, operational performance metrics, and dynamic visualization to provide the required granularity for attack inference, localization, and impact estimation. We illustrate how the focus on visual domain-aware anomaly exploration leads to performance improvement, more precise anomaly localization, and effective risk prioritization. Proposed elements of the method can be used independently, supporting the exploration of various anomaly detection methods. It thus can facilitate the effective management of operational risk by providing rich context information and bridging the interpretation gap.

ID INTELLIGENCE
AB Cyberattacks are increasing in number and diversity in nature daily, and the tendency for them is to escalate dramatically in the forseeable future, with critical infrastructures (CI) assets and networks not being an exception to this trend. As time goes by, cyberattacks are more complex than before and unknown until they spawn, being very difficult to detect and remediate. To be reactive against those cyberattacks, usually defined as zero-day attacks, cyber-security specialists known as threat hunters must be in organizations' security departments. All the data generated by the organization's users must be processed by those threat hunters (which are mainly benign and repetitive and follow predictable patterns) in short periods to detect unusual behaviors. The application of artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning (ML) techniques (for instance NLP, C-RNN-GAN, or GNN), can remarkably impact the real-time analysis of those data and help to discriminate between harmless data and malicious data, but not every technique is helpful in every circumstance; as a consequence, those specialists must know which techniques fit the best at every specific moment. The main goal of the present work is to design a distributed and scalable system for threat hunting based on ML, and with a special focus on critical infrastructure needs and characteristics.

AB Nowadays, industrial control system (ICS) has begun to integrate with the Internet. While the Internet has brought convenience to ICS, it has also brought severe security concerns. Traditional ICS network traffic anomaly detection methods rely on statistical features manually extracted using the experience of network security experts. They are not aimed at the original network data, nor can they capture the potential characteristics of network packets. Therefore, the following improvements were made in this study: (1) A dataset that can be used to evaluate anomaly detection algorithms is produced, which provides raw network data. (2) A request response-based convolutional neural network named RRCNN is proposed, which can be used for anomaly detection of ICS network traffic. Instead of using statistical features manually extracted by security experts, this method uses the byte sequences of the original network packets directly, which can extract potential features of the network packets in greater depth. It regards the request packet and response packet in a session as a Request-Response Pair (RRP). The feature of RRP is extracted using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, and then the RRP is judged to be normal or abnormal based on the extracted feature. Experimental results demonstrate that this model is better than several other machine learning and neural network models, with F1, accuracy, precision, and recall above 99%.

AB The integration of the Industrial Control System (ICS) with corporate intranets and the internet has exposed the previously isolated SCADA system to a wide range of cyberattacks. Interestingly, the vulnerabilities in the Modbus protocol, with which the ICS communicates, make data obfuscation and communication between component entities less secure. In this work, we propose a Common Features Technique (CFT) for Lightweight Intrusion Detection based on an ensembled feature selection approach. Our Common Features Technique, which used fewer features, was able to detect intrusion at the same level as models using information gain, Chi-Squared, and Gini Index feature selection techniques datasets after fitting Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) models. More importantly, when p-values were computed, the CFT model computation time and memory usage were statistically significantly different at 95% and 90% Confidence Interval (CI) when compared to the model on the other techniques.

AB Society reaps the benefits of networking technologies, with the number of connected citizens and devices constantly on the rise. The convenience and efficiency brought by connected technologies are adopted in normal households and industrial plants alike. As the proliferation of the technology expands, the incentives for malicious users to cause mischief are also getting stronger. This causes an influx in cyber incidents. To deal with the rising cyberthreats, a suite of defensive methods has been proposed. One prominent example is network intrusion detection systems. The Machine-Learning-based network intrusion detection systems utilised in critical infrastructure or soft target protection offer many benefits, but still, need improvements in numerous areas. This paper contains a proposition of an improved network intrusion detection system featuring a Siamese network as a few-shot learner. The used NetFlow features allow the system to perform real-time intrusion detection, the Siamese network allows spotting attacks from classes that were not used during the training of the network, and the used sampling method allows circumventing the over-counting problem when formulating sample pairs to train the Siamese networks. The results of the research are presented and show promise.

AB High-Power electric grid networks require extreme security in their associated telecommunication network to ensure protection and control throughout power transmission. Accordingly, supervisory control and data acquisition systems form a vital part of any critical infrastructure, and the safety of the associated telecommunication network from intrusion is crucial. Whereas events related to operation and maintenance are often available and carefully documented, only some tools have been proposed to discriminate the information dealing with the heterogeneous data from intrusion detection systems and to support the network engineers. In this work, we present the use of deep learning techniques, such as Autoencoders or conventional Multiple Correspondence Analysis, to analyze and prune the events on power communication networks in terms of categorical data types often used in anomaly and intrusion detection (such as addresses or anomaly description). This analysis allows us to quantify and statistically describe high-severity events. Overall, portions of alerts around 5-10% have been prioritized in the analysis as first to handle by managers. Moreover, probability clouds of alerts have been shown to configure explicit manifolds in latent spaces. These results offer a homogeneous framework for implementing anomaly detection prioritization in power communication networks.

AB With the rapid development of network technologies, the network security of industrial control systems has aroused widespread concern. As a defense mechanism, an ideal intrusion detection system (IDS) can effectively detect abnormal behaviors in a system without affecting the performance of the industrial control system (ICS). Many deep learning methods are used to build an IDS, which rely on massive numbers of variously labeled samples for model training. However, network traffic is imbalanced, and it is difficult for researchers to obtain sufficient attack samples. In addition, the attack variants are rich, and constructing all possible attack types in advance is impossible. In order to overcome these challenges and improve the performance of an IDS, this paper presents a novel intrusion detection approach which integrates a one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder (1DCAE) and support vector data description (SVDD) for the first time. For the two-stage training process, 1DCAE fails to retain the key features of intrusion detection and SVDD has to add restrictions, so a joint optimization solution is introduced. A three-stage optimization process is proposed to obtain better performance. Experiments on the benchmark intrusion detection dataset NSL-KDD show that the proposed method can effectively detect various unknown attacks, learning with only normal traffic. Compared with the recent state-of-art intrusion detection baselines, the proposed method is improved in most metrics.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION; MODEL
AB In the open network environment, industrial control systems face huge security risks and are often subject to network attacks. The existing abnormal detection methods of industrial control networks have the problem of a low intelligence degree of adaptive detection and recognition. To overcome this problem, this article makes full use of the advantages of deep reinforcement learning in decision-making and builds a learning system with continuous learning ability. Specifically, industrial control network and deep reinforcement learning characteristics are applied to design a unique reward and learning mechanism. Moreover, an industrial control anomaly detection system based on deep reinforcement learning is constructed. Finally, we verify the algorithm on the gas pipeline industrial control dataset of Mississippi State University. The experimental results show that the convergence rate of this model is signicantly higher than that of traditional deep learning methods. More importantly, this model can get a higher F1 score.

AB Industrial Control System (ICS), which is based on Industrial IoT (IIoT), has an intelligent mobile environment that supports various mobility, but there is a limit to relying only on the physical security of the ICS environment. Due to various threat factors that can disrupt the workflow of the IIoT, machine learning-based anomaly detection technologies are being presented; it is also essential to study for increasing detection performance to minimize model errors for promoting stable ICS operation. In this paper, we established the requirements for improving the anomaly detection performance in the IIoT-based ICS environment by analyzing the related cases. After that, we presented an improving method of the performance of a machine learning model specialized for IIoT-based ICS, which increases the detection rate by applying correlation coefficients and clustering; it provides a mechanism to predict thresholds on a per-sequence. Likewise, we adopted the HAI dataset environment that actively reflected the characteristics of IIoT-based ICS and demonstrated that performance could be improved through comparative experiments with the traditional method and our proposed method. The presented method can further improve the performance of commonly applied error-based detection techniques and includes a primary method that can be enhanced over existing detection techniques by analyzing correlation coefficients between features to consider feedback between ICS components. Those can contribute to improving the performance of several detection models applied in ICS and other areas.

AB Integrating traditional critical infrastructure "physical" and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) "cyber" enables many services and can make the cyber-physical system (CPS) more efficient and effective. However, ICT exposes the critical infrastructure outside of its physically closed perimeter, making it vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Although defence systems based upon machine learning algorithms are recently adopted to protect against cyberattacks to CPS, there remains a challenge to choose the most suitable ML system for the underlying CPS. Therefore, this paper benchmarks performance of various machine learning algorithms on four different CPS datasets in two dimensions. First, the performance of machine learning algorithms is benchmarked in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. Second, the computation requirement is benchmarked during training, prediction, and deployment. Our comprehensive experimental results will help to decide the machine model with the best performance for critical infrastructure with various computation and communication limitations. The experimental result found that a linear model is faster, and bulk prediction is more suitable for CPS. The decision tree is one of the appropriate models considering detection performance and model size.

AB With the rapid spread and advent of Industry 4.0 tools and technologies, including IoT, Machine Learning, cloud, virtualization, and digital twins, many organizations around the globe have recently started to either retrain their workforce or hire experts from other industries with relevant experience to incorporate such technologies into their systems. In many cases, this transition requires hands- on experience that could be gained through hands-on training programs. However, providing such programs has become challenging with remote working routines. A Virtualized Experiential Learning Platform (VELP) has been developed recently by BCIT's Smart Microgrid Applied Research Team with the support of Future Skills Centre and industrial partners in order for trainees to get hands-on experience in critical energy infrastructure studies such as substation automation systems, microgrids, and industrial control cybersecurity. Through virtualization technologies such as digital twins, real-time simulation, and cloud, trainees can gain an adequate level of experience working with virtualized as well as physical assets and systems remotely. This paper primarily reviews VELP's features and functionalities. It then describes the steps for developing a reliable and secure virtualized experiential learning platform. Last but not least, the paper explains VELP's tools for industrial control cybersecurity training and proposes a cyber-secure topology with its components to keep such virtualization platforms cyber-secure against cyber threats.

AB Defending industrial control systems and other networks from cyber attack requires timely responses to alerts and threat intelligence. Decisions about how to respond involve coordinating actions across multiple nodes based on imperfect indicators of compromise while minimizing disruptions to network operations. Currently, playbooks are used to automate portions of a response process, but often leave complex decision-making to a human analyst. In this work, we present a deep reinforcement learning approach to autonomous response and recovery in large industrial control networks. We propose an attention-based neural architecture that is flexible to the size of the network under protection. To train and evaluate the autonomous defender agent, we present an industrial control network simulation environment suitable for reinforcement learning. Experiments show that the learned agent can effectively mitigate advanced attacks that progress with few observable signals over several months before execution. The proposed application of AI/ML techniques for security outperforms a fully automated playbook method in simulation, taking less disruptive actions while also defending more nodes on the network. The learned policy is also more robust to changes in attacker behavior than playbook approaches.

AB Cyberattacks on Industrial Control and Automation Systems (ICAS) have significantly increased in recent years due to IT and OT convergence. Traditionally, ICAS were isolated systems running proprietary protocols on specialised software and hardware. However, to improve business processes and efficiency, ICAS vendors are adopting smart technologies such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), Machine to Machine (M2M), Digital Twin, cloud computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This integration presents new vulnerabilities in ICAS that can be exploited by threat actors. ICAS are utilised in critical infrastructure and widely used in power, nuclear plant, water, oil, natural gas, and manufacturing industries. Therefore, cyberattacks on these systems can pose a significant threat to humans and the environment, disrupt social services, cause financial losses, and threaten national security. Because of these threats, numerous mitigation measures are being implemented to protect ICAS from cyberattacks. However, security experience and expertise have demonstrated that we can never fully protect a system and one should never propose that their solution will fully protect. Rather one can claim that their solution / mitigation technique adds a layer to the defence in depth approach. This paper discusses the different cybersecurity standards and frameworks for ICAS, investigates the existing threats and vulnerabilities, and methods of securing ICAS

AB The importance of automated intrusion detection systems, not only in network infrastructures, but also in critical and industrial infrastructures is becoming more evident with the significant increase of cyber-attacks targeting such infrastructures. The most recent research initiatives in this field focus on unsupervised learning methods, due to a constant lack of labelled datasets of a good quality. This paper proposes an enhanced autoencoder based anomaly detection approach for water distribution cyber-attack detection. The proposed approach contains a pipeline of methods, including feature engineering as a pre-processing step, anomaly estimation based on autoencoder, and scores smoothing as a post-processing step. The obtained results are very promising compared to existing approaches.

AB Cybersecurity risks, together with the associated physical security risks, are hindering the advancement of smart building innovations and applications. The cyber-physical (CP) security for smart built environments is an emerging, critical challenge that cannot be addressed solely by existing cybersecurity means nor traditional physical security means. Currently, because of rapid developments in smart building-related technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyberphysical Systems, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), researchers and industry professionals need a state-of-the-art overview of the solutions for CP security threats in smart built environments. Through a systematic literature review, this paper summarizes and discusses existing management means and methods to achieve more secured built environments. The content analysis results show that most research studies are in the area of smart grids and power systems' CP security, with focuses such as intrusion detection, cyberattack impact mitigation, system status monitoring, and system resilience improvement. The existing gaps of built-environment CP security research include human factors, coordinated attacks, preventive solutions, and the interactions between cybersecurity and physical security.

AB Background: Systematic/stochastic pattern defects affect the production yield of integrated circuits (IC) containing trillions of 10-nm level features.
   Aim: We detect pattern anomalies/defects from images obtained from scanning electron microscopes (SEM) for random/arbitrary IC patterns without using design data.
   Approach: We decompose SEM images into small sub-images and apply an identical autoencoder to each of them to detect anomalies. The astronomical varieties in random IC patterns are reduced into limited varieties in elementary patterns, which are coded onto limited dimension latent vectors in autoencoder. The discrepancy between autoencoder input and output represents a deviation of local pattern shapes from ideal or allowed ones and is used as an index of anomaly.
   Results: A wide variety of anomalies/defects are detected in regular and random IC patterns fabricated by extreme ultra-violet lithography without prior knowledge about anomalies at a high signal-to-noise ratio within a time shorter than the typical image acquisition time of SEMs. They include missing/necking in holes/trenches, collapsing/breaking in lines, various local pattern distortion/deformation, and tiny particles. Frequency and spatial distributions of the discrepancy index are sensitive to process changes and can be used for visualizing the sign or causes of anomalies.
   Conclusions: The method is effective for inspecting memory and random logic ICs with high-speed SEMs. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) suffer from extendable vulnerabilities due to the convergence of the physical world with the cyber world, which makes it victim to a number of sophisticated cyber-attacks. The motives behind such attacks range from criminal enterprises to military, economic, espionage, political, and terrorism-related activities. Many governments are more concerned than ever with securing their critical infrastructure. One of the effective means of detecting threats and securing their infrastructure is the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). A number of studies have been conducted and proposed to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of IDS through the use of self-learning techniques, especially in the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) era. This paper investigates and analyzes the utilization of IDS systems and their proposed solutions used to enhance the effectiveness of such systems for CPS. The targeted data extraction was from 2011 to 2021 from five selected sources: IEEE, ACM, Springer, Wiley, and ScienceDirect. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 primary studies were selected from a total of 51 studies in the field of threat detection in CPS, ICS, SCADA systems, and the IoT. The outcome revealed the trends in recent research in this area and identified essential techniques to improve detection performance, accuracy, reliability, and robustness. In addition, this study also identified the most vulnerable target layer for cyber-attacks in CPS. Various challenges, opportunities, and solutions were identified The findings can help scholars in the field learn about how machine learning (ML) methods are used in intrusion detection systems. As a future direction, more research should explore the benefits of ML to safeguard cyber-physical systems.

AB AI Planning (or Automated Planning) is a sub-field within AI which has been applied to several information security sub-fields, particularly vulnerability detection and incident response. Compared to other AI techniques such as machine learning, AI planning has the advantage of requiring no data or datasets to train. Instead, an entity within a domain is modelled, describing the relevant features of an environment, the goals, constraints, and the actions available to the entity. This paper surveys the traditional field of automated planning and explores its application to the field of information security and in particular, automating cyber incident response. Relevant AI planning techniques are then applied to implement a prototype which demonstrates the feasibility of automating incident response, focusing on False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) against smart grid as a use case. The effectiveness of this prototype is validated on a digital twin power delivery system at The University of Queensland Industry 4.0 Energy Testlab. The effectiveness of this prototype is quantitatively assessed with reference to best industry practice before discussing the strengths and weaknesses of adopting AI planning for incident response, and information security domains generally.

AB Recent adversarial incidents highlight the inherent vulnerabilities in multiple targeted critical infrastructures cyber-physical systems. Next-Gen critical infrastructures will continue evolving to be more distributed, inter-connected, and interdependent. Significant negative consequences could be inflected by threat actors exploiting those characteristics, requiring a more comprehensive and systematic approach. This work proposes a data-based hierarchical framework to identify, detect, and mitigate cyber and/or physical attacks through enriched dynamic situational awareness encompassing individual and interdependent critical infrastructures.

AB The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into the modern power system makes it a complicated cyber-physical system (CPS). In this case, an adversary may find some loopholes, penetrate to CPS layer, compromise data, and consequently result in security and stability issues. In this paper, we proposed a laboratory set up to emulate the attacker's behavior and then detect the injected false data. To this end, RTU hardware and software are used to simulate a typical SCADA system. A protocol analyzer software is also employed to simulate a cyber-attack, inject false data, and send it to the control center. In the second stage, we developed a two-stage framework to detect FDIA. First, the LSTM, as a supervised learning algorithm, is utilized to build a predictive model. In this process, hyperparameter optimization is implemented to improve the accuracy of the developed model. In the second stage, an unsupervised scoring algorithm is applied to the real-time data to find the sequences of injected false data. Also, a penalty factor is considered during the detection procedure to prevent the algorithm from greedy search behavior. Simulation results on a real-world data set (Chicago load/weather) show the proposed method's effectiveness in the cyberattack implementation and FDIA detection problem.

AB The convergence of the Operational Technology (OT) sector with the Internet of Things (IoT) devices has increased cyberattacks on prominent OT devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). These devices have limited computational capabilities, no antivirus support, strict real-time requirements, and often older, unpatched operating systems. The use of traditional malware detection approaches can impact the real-time performance of such devices. Due to these constraints, we propose Amaya, an external malware detection mechanism based on a combination of signature detection and machine learning. This technique employs remote analysis of malware binaries collected from the main memory of the PLC by a non-intrusive method using the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) port. We evaluate Amaya against in-the-wild malware for ARM and x86 architecture, achieving an accuracy of approximate to 98% and approximate to 94.7%, respectively. Furthermore, we analyze concept drift, spatial experimental bias, and the effects of downsampling the feature vector to understand the behavior of the model in a real-world setting.

AB Adversarial learning is used to test the robustness of machine learning algorithms under attack and create attacks that deceive the anomaly detection methods in Industrial Control System (ICS). Given that security assessment of an ICS demands that an exhaustive set of possible attack patterns is studied, in this work, we propose an association rule mining-based attack generation technique. The technique has been implemented using data from a Secure Water Treatment plant. The proposed technique was able to generate more than 110,000 attack patterns constituting a vast majority of new attack vectors which were not seen before. Automatically generated attacks improve our understanding of the potential attacks and enable the design of robust attack detection techniques.

AB Cyber attacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are considered to be an extremely dangerous threat as they lead material losses or undermine a process. These attacks are mostly targeted to the field level of the critical systems. EtherCAT, one of the most preferred hard real-time protocol in Europe is also open to both known and zero-day attacks. In this work, EtherCAT based anomaly detection is studied applying machine learning methods. To do this, first, a water level control testbed is developed in laboratory scale. Attack vectors are created, and a dataset is formed considering EtherCAT communication principles. Secondly, attributes related to the running-process are selected and reduced. Finally, anomalies are detected both for supervised and unsupervised methods and an evaluation of the methods are done. Results showed that, SVM and Random Forest can be used for EtherCAT anomaly detection as supervised methods. It is also observed that each algorithm applied in unsupervised learning is successful in detecting a specific attack trace.

AB The development and convergence of information and communication technologies have been leading to various studies on big data, artificial intelligence, internet of things, and smart cars to be introduced to our daily life. Especially, Smart factory which also base on ICT technology mentioned above are gradually applied to automation of intelligent manufacturing processes which is used to take place in a factory to drive down manufacturing costs and time to profit. Like governments that already encourage the introduction of smart factories, individuals and organizations are also considering introduction of smart factories. Smart factory requires modbus protocol to communicate and it must come with ICS, SCADA, PLC. These systems are greatly important in terms of security. However, using some of public website like Shodan makes it possible to search easily networks related to critical systems and devices. For safe and secure operation in smart factory, we need to raise awareness to these kind of security vulnerabilities in the ICS so that smart factories can cope with security accidents that might occur. In addition, for successfully introduction and activation of smart factories, security vulnerabilities must be reduced by using security measures and security devices should be applied for the ICS. As a baseline work for security improvement, we arrange the potential security vulnerabilities by conducting various real-world experiments and propose some security measures. Through this research, we expect to encourage security awareness of using smart factories which are undoubtedly important issue.

AB Technological advancements in the information systems and networks are the outcome of potential developments resulting in the networking and communications. The role of Critical Infrastructure is playing a vital role in imparting the condition of effective information systems management. However, with some of the negative developments like DDoS attacks that impact the operations of network application systems, there are adverse set of issues encountered. With the rising number of DDoS attacks phenomenon, researchers have focused on developing contemporary solutions that can support in thwarting such attacks. From the review of such models in the literature review, it is imperative that two distinct dimensions like the detection and mitigation accuracy levels has scope for improvement and profoundly majority of such models were tested on the static datasets which are not pragmatic. Considering such equations, the model proposed in this manuscript focused on a contemporary range of solution that can be high on accuracy rate and also is tested over the dynamic dataset to understand the efficacy of the system. Using the ensemble classifiers comprising drift detection features, at service request stream level, the proposed solution if implemented can lead to better levels of detection. Experimental study of the model carried out using the service request stream that is synthesized is tested based on statistical metrics like accuracy, prediction value and true negative rates. Significance of the model is imperative in terms of results generated and its comparative analysis to the other bench-mark models in the segment.

AB A high growth rate in network traffic and the complexity of cyber threats have made it necessary to create more effective and flexible intrusion detection systems. Most traditional Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) can become weak at detecting new patterns of attacks due to the use of obsolete data or traditional machine learning models. To overcome the mentioned constraints, the current research presents a new deep learning solution that combines Sequential Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation unit with an Extra Tree Classifier feature selection procedure. The proposed model is trained and tested on the new rich and up-to-date UNSW-NB15 set, which provides a realistic reflection of the real-life network traffic and attack vectors. The interesting novelty of this study is the tactical use of ReLU-based DNN combined with feature optimization through the Extra Tree Classifier, which not only overcomes general problems like vanishing gradients and overfitting but also greatly increases the interpretability of the model and the efficiency of its computation. This dimensional reduction of the feature space (43 to only 8 highly relevant features) retains the high accuracy of the model but with better inference speed, which is a crucial aspect of the real-time deployment of NIDS. The results show that with the Sequential DNN approach, the binary class (0 for normal and 1 for attack records) achieved 97.93% accuracy, 97% Precision, 97% Recall and 97% F1-score. Furthermore, the detailed experimental testing, such as ROC curves and Confusion Matrices, confirmed that the Sequential DNN performed well in comparison to other Existing Studies. These findings underscore the effectiveness of deep learning architectures enhanced with optimized feature selection in detecting network intrusions, making the proposed system a promising solution for securing critical infrastructure in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and government networks.

AB A cyber-physical system (CPS) is the foundation of modern industrial infrastructures but is vulnerable to cyber attacks due to its connectivity. Detecting these attacks is crucial, driving research into machine learning and deep learning-based models for intrusion detection systems. Many of these models, though effective, suffer from high computational complexity and large parameter counts, limiting their practicality for real-time deployment. Additionally, extensive data preprocessing, commonly used in attack detection, can introduce drawbacks such as loss of critical information, reduced interpretability, and increased latency. This paper employs the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) as a lightweight and efficient alternative to conventional models for attack detection in CPSs. With a compact architecture and significantly fewer parameters, KAN achieves high classification accuracy while minimizing computational overhead. It eliminates the need for complex feature extraction and preprocessing, preserving data integrity and enabling faster decision-making. Evaluated on the SWaT, WADI, and ICS-Flow datasets, KAN demonstrates superior performance in detecting cyber attacks across binary and multi-class tasks on both physical and network data. Its low inference time and minimal resource requirements make it a practical solution for real-time CPS security.

AB In today's interconnected world, nearly every aspect of modern life relies on internet-based services. However, the widespread adoption of these services has led to a significant increase in cyberattacks, particularly Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks-which pose a major threat to the stability of critical infrastructure. Therefore, timely and accurate detection of DDoS attacks is essential for cybersecurity. Although deep learning has shown promise in intrusion detection, existing systems often struggle with multiclass DDoS classification, class imbalance, and adaptability to evolving traffic patterns-especially in resource-constrained IoT and IIoT environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel lightweight hybrid deep learning model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, and an attention mechanism to enhance feature extraction and improve classification performance. The model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, CICDDoS2019 and Edge-IIoT, achieving classification accuracies of 99.78% and 98.84%, and ROC-AUC scores of 100% and 99.98%, respectively. Comparative analysis with baseline models and prior studies highlights the model's robustness, efficiency, and suitability for real-time deployment in diverse and constrained environments.

AB In this paper, we develop a Hybrid Non-zero-sum Multi-stage Partial-information Stochastic (HNMPS) game theoretic model for assessing the security of interdependent cyber-physical power systems (CPPS). In the cyber layer, HNMPS encapsulates the discrete dynamics of attacks, with tactics and techniques defined in the ICS MITRE ATT&CK framework. In the physical layer, it evaluates the consequence of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the transient stability of power networks through non-linear continuous dynamic analysis. Next, we propose an Imperfect-Information Multi-Agent Q-learning (IMQL) algorithm to solve the game when opposing players' actions and strategies are unknown. Unlike existing methods, IMQL doesn't require joint Nash strategy computation and therefore relaxes the strong assumption on existing global optima or saddle point. We further prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Based on the outcome of the HNMPS, we introduce the Cyber Security Index Level (CIL), a novel metric that quantifies the probability of physical layer intrusion following a breach in the cyber layer. To validate our model, we conduct simulations on the Western System Coordinating Council (WECC) 9-bus system coupled with a cyber network, employing an attack scenario inspired by the BlackEnergy v3 malware. Results indicate the successful convergence and robustness of the learning process under partial information settings compared to existing algorithms.

AB The emergence of quantum computing seriously threatens the security of legacy cryptographic protocols in consumer electronics devices based on the Internet of Things (IoT). These are essential components of mission-critical infrastructures, such as industrial control systems, smart grids, and healthcare. In particular, this work examines how to strengthen the resistance of the IoT to classical and quantum-based cyberattacks by combining deep learning methods with post-quantum cryptography (PQC). To protect key exchange, encryption, and authentication processes in IoT-consumer devices, we will continue to use quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, including lattice-based, hash-based, and code-based cryptography. To provide real-time anomaly detection and response capabilities, we suggest a hybrid security framework combining PQC with deep learning-based intrusion detection systems. Our methodology ensures secure communications and data exchanges linked to quantum attacks in the future within IoT systems while leveraging continuous learning over time to allow Intrusion Detection System (IDS) models to adapt to new attack vectors. We suggest optimized algorithms for PQC solutions that are lightweight and suitable for deployment in edge computing nodes and Internet of Things devices, considering the resource-constrained IoT situations where PQC implementation would be difficult. Through comparative studies and simulations, we demonstrate how our integrated PQC-deep learning framework offers an improved IoT security solution that could safeguard vital systems in a world powered by quantum technology. The results shows the key generation time which is 12.5ms, encryption/decryption time 25.3ms, latency 18.7ms, throughput 5000 operations/sec and energy consumption 2.4mJ.

AB SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems are critical for managing industrial processes, including energy production, manufacturing, and transportation. However, their reliance on protocols such as Modbus, which lack inherent security features, exposes them to sophisticated cyber threats. This paper explores vulnerabilities in the Modbus protocol to design advanced SCADA-specific attack scenarios-SCADA Hijacking and SCADA Blackout. These covert attacks exploit protocol weaknesses to manipulate process parameters or halt operations while evading detection by intrusion detection systems (IDS) and human operators, representing a significant escalation in the sophistication of cyber threats. To counter these threats, we propose a novel machine learning-based defense mechanism that incorporates heterogeneous graph embeddings, combining multimodal network data such as flow-level and packet-level features. The proposed attacks and defense mechanism were rigorously evaluated using precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rate as key metrics, demonstrating the stealthiness of the attacks and the robustness of the defense. By exposing critical vulnerabilities and presenting an advanced intrusion detection framework, this research establishes a foundation for strengthening SCADA systems against evolving cyber threats, ensuring the security and reliability of industrial control systems.

AB Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks; hence, cybersecurity is a major concern. Hybrid methodologies using advanced machine learning (ML) may increase intrusion detection and system security. The intrusion detection algorithms have little adaptability, high false-positive rates for novel threats, and restricted feature extraction. SCADA systems are subject to sophisticated attacks. This study's hybrid autoencoder-hybrid ResNet-long short-term memory (LSTM) (HAE-HRL) architecture includes deep feature extraction, anomaly detection, and sequential analysis. This framework uses these three methods to improve threat detection. AI can scan massive amounts of data and find patterns humans and traditional systems miss. The hybrid approach gives defenders an unequal edge. Autoencoders identify anomalies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract features, and hybrid ResNet-LSTM learns temporal patterns. Cyber risks are correctly classified using this method. With SCADA security and intrusion detection, the model may considerably enhance network abnormality and hostile activity detection. According to experimental tests, HAE-HRL reduces false positives and improves detection accuracy, making it a robust cybersecurity solution.

AB Smart grids are an emergent concept that has evolved from combining renewable energy source integration, digital communication advances, and increasing demands for dependable electricity supply. However, although these modernized grids make the process very efficient and reliable, at the same time, the increased vulnerability to cyberattacks makes the need for Intrusion Detection Systems robust, as these infrastructures are critical ones. Traditional intrusion detection systems frequently tend to be inadequate in managing the intricacy and continually evolving nature of threats associated with smart grids. This paper presents a streamlined deep-learning approach for developing an IDS. The process involves the following: a) Data Collection: DNP3 is widely used in most CIs across the United States for industrial communication protocol. It permits remote access between ICS and SCADA systems. b) Preprocessing using Encoding and Normalisation techniques to avoid anomalies and noises from the raw dataset, c) Feature Extraction for extracting features of the smart grid using Autoencoder, and d) Detection using Graphical Convolutional Network (GCN). GCN-based IDS demonstrates superior potential in identifying sophisticated cyber threats, ensuring real-time detection, and maintaining the integrity and reliability of smart grids. The experimental analysis's findings show that the recommended approach outperforms current cutting-edge models, displaying exceptional sensitivity (0.98), specificity (0.98), accuracy (0.95), and F1 score (91).

AB In the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) network of a smart grid, the network switch is connected to multiple Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) that are based on protective relays. False-Data Injection Attacks (FDIA), Remote-Tripping Command Injection (RTCI), and System Reconfiguration Attacks (SRA) are three types of cyber-attacks on SCADA networks, resulting in single-line-to-ground (SLG) fault, IED-relay failure, and circuit-breaker open issues occur. The existing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) approaches of grids are unable to provide visualization of cyber-attacking grid effects. To understand the full effect of the attacks, there is a need for a knowledge-graph method-based digital-twin cyber-attack visualization approach in SCADA networks, which is missing in existing SCADA systems. This study presents a novel "Digital-twin and Machine Learning-based SCADA Cyber Threat Intelligence (DT-ML-SCADA-CTI)" approach, which utilizes an innovative algorithm to visualize and predict the effects of cyber-attacks, including FDIA, RTCI, and SRA, on SCADA systems. The process begins with data transformation to generate cyber-attack grid data, which is then analyzed for attack prediction using machine learning models such as Extra-Trees, XGBoost, Random Forest, Bootstrap Aggregating, and Logistic Regression. To further enhance the analysis, a directed-graph (DiGraph) algorithm is applied to create a knowledge-graph-based digital twin, allowing for a deeper understanding of how these cyber-attacks impact SCADA operations. The comparison with existing models demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach, as it offers a more detailed and clearer digital-twin representation of cyber-attack effects. This enhanced visualization provides deeper insights into attack dynamics and significantly improves predictive accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method in understanding and mitigating cyber threats.

AB The implementation of comprehensive security measures is a critical factor in the rapid growth of industrial control networks. Federated Learning has emerged as a viable solution for safeguarding privacy in machine learning. The effectiveness of pattern detection in models is diminished as a result of the difficulty in extracting attack information from extremely large datasets and obtaining an adequate number of examples for specific types of attacks. A robust Federated Learning method, CGFL, is introduced in this study to resolve the challenges presented by data distribution discrepancies and client class imbalance. By employing a data generation strategy to generate balanced datasets for each client, CGFL enhances the global model. It employs a data generator that integrates artificially generated data with the existing data from local clients by employing label correction and data generation techniques. The geometric median aggregation technique was implemented to enhance the security of the aggregation process. The model was simulated and evaluated using the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, NSL-KDD dataset, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. The experimental results indicate that CGFL does an effective job of enhancing the accuracy of ICS attack detection in Federated Learning under imbalanced sample conditions.

AB The recent rapid increase in ransomware attacks has heightened threat levels for various targets, including critical infrastructure. Traditional signature-based detection methods are effective against known ransomware but struggle to address unknown and obfuscated attacks. Furthermore, in current machine-learning-based detection approaches, files are at risk of encryption during the detection time, i.e., the time taken from detection of the ransomware to its termination. In response to these issues, this study proposes the Real-time Open-File Backup System (ROFBS), which aims to minimize encryption damage by performing immediate backups upon file opening detection. We conduct three experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of ROFBS. First, we measure the backup ratio during ransomware attacks and find consistently high backup rates for ROFBS. Second, we analyze detection time trends and find that longer detection times correlate with an increase in encrypted files. Third, we measure central processing unit, memory, and disk input/output usage. Results indicate that the impact of ROFBS on normal system performance is minimal. These experiments not only quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of ROFBS but also highlight the importance of considering detection time in future research. The results of this study suggest that ROFBS can enhance defense against ransomware attacks and ensure data security.

AB Anomaly detection of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) plays a crucial role in ensuring system safety and improving product quality. However, traditional anomaly detection techniques often face significant challenges when dealing with data imbalance, dynamic spatial relationships, and temporal dependencies. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative anomaly detection method called Graph-driven SpatioTemporal Adversarial Deep Support Vector Data Description (GSTA-DeSVDD). Specifically, GSTA-DeSVDD builds an anomaly detection framework by combining spatio-temporal embedding with adversarial DeSVDD one-class classifier. For capturing the spatial relationships effectively, a hybrid static-dynamic graph learning strategy is designed in the Residual Graph Convolutional Networks (res-GCN) to capture global and local spatial dependencies in the data. Moreover, an attention-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is introduced to mine time series data dependencies. Finally, an adversarial one-class classifier is constructed by leveraging anomaly data generated through adversarial learning to assist accurate DeSVDD modeling. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that this proposed model outperforms the comparative methods in anomaly detection tasks.
